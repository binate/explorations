# Plan: native HFA (struct-of-floats → SIMD) ABI conformance

**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS REPLAN.** The native-first staging below is WRONG. Stage 1 (aa64
HFA args) was landed (`332b4298`) then **GATED BACK OFF** (`1a790663`, 2026-07-02) after
an adversarial review found native-only HFA enablement miscompiles/crashes: HFA passing
is a **cross-backend ABI contract** and the LLVM backend (all deps route through it) +
the aa64 dispatch shims + the variadic NSRN walkers all still use GP. See the CRITICAL
"HFA-in-SIMD is a cross-backend contract" entry in `claude-todo.md` for the full
findings, repros, and the correct staging (classify HFAs identically in codegen/LLVM +
shims + variadic walkers + native, flip the flag on only when ALL agree). The
investigation + native arg path below remain useful reference; the *staging* does not.

## Why (accurate framing)

The native backends (aa64 AAPCS64, x64 SysV) pass a Homogeneous Floating-point
Aggregate (a struct/array of floats) as a **GP aggregate**, not in SIMD registers.
This is **self-consistent within native** (verified: 2×f64, 3×f64/24B, 4×f32,
float-struct-return iface dispatch all PASS on native aa64+x64) — so it is NOT a
native-dispatch miscompile. It is an **ABI-nonconformance**: it mismatches the
standard ABI (C/clang, LLVM) at a cross-ABI boundary (C-extern-by-value-HFA,
mixed-backend, VM→native cross-mode HFA-struct). User-requested conformance fix.

## Root cause / hooks (REPORT 1)

No HFA concept exists in the tree. Every FP-register path keys on the scalar
predicate `common.IsFloatScalarTyp` (`common.bn:368`, TYP_FLOAT only). A
struct-of-floats is `IsAggregateTyp` (`common.bn:350`) → GP/by-ref path.

**Shared classifier (the primary hook):**
- `common_callconv.bn:222 argRegWordsStackWords(t, ngrn, nsrn) → (regStart, regWords, stackWords)`.
  Scalar-float branch at 227-230. Add an HFA branch ABOVE `var agg`: while
  `nsrn + N ≤ NumFpArgRegs` return `-1,0,0` (rides FP, no GP/stack); on overflow
  return `-1,0,N*memberWords` (**all-or-nothing**, never split, regardless of
  `SplitAggregates`).
- `advanceNgrn` (`common_callconv.bn:290`): exclude an in-FP HFA from GP saturation
  (like the scalar-float exclusion at :292).
- The 3 NSRN walkers must advance `nsrn` by **N** (not 1) for an HFA:
  `CallArgRegStart` (:323, incr :330), `CallArgStackOff` (:411, incr :426),
  `CallStackBytes` (:437, incr :448). Variadic V-variant `argRegWordsStackWordsV`
  (:310) forces variadic floats to stack — HFA variadic likely same.
- CallConv fields: `NumFpArgRegs` (8/8), `NumFpRetRegs` (8/2), `NumX87RetRegs`
  (0/2) at `common.bni:25`, constructors `common_callconv.bn:13/40/53`.

**Return (REPORT 1 §1d):** single named-struct return classified only by
`SizeOf()>16` (`FuncReturnsBigAggregate` :14 / `CallReturnsBigAggregate` :25). An
HFA return (≤32B) must route to FP return regs. `MultiReturnTupleNeedsSret` (:56)
already does per-field GP/FP split (`fpCount`) — the template.

**aa64 emitter:** caller placement `aarch64_call.bn:56-93` (scalar-float `Fmov_gp_to_fp(D0+nsrn,src); nsrn++` — extend to N members into `D0+nsrn+m`, `nsrn+=N`); callee prologue `aarch64_emit_func.bn:83-113`; return `aarch64_return.bn:110-118` (scalar) + multi-return per-field pack :126-160. Regs: `argReg(i)`→X0..X7, FP = `aarch64.D0+nsrn`; moves `Fmov_gp_to_fp`/`Fmov_fp_to_gp`.

**x64 emitter:** analogous in `pkg/binate/native/x64/*` (report truncated — re-derive from x64_call.bn / x64_emit_func.bn / x64_return.bn; scalar-float → XMM path is the template).

## Rules / decision table (REPORT 2) — per-target, NOT shared

aa64 HFA = 1–4 members ALL same float type (fold nested struct/array flat);
>16B still HFA (up to 4×f64). x64 = eightbyte classification: ≤16B all-SSE
eightbytes → XMM; >16B → MEM; mixed-width `{f32,f64}` → SIMD2 on x64 (x64 does
NOT require same width); mixed int+float → split GP+XMM.

| struct shape | size | aa64 | x64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| {f32,f32}/f32[2] | 8B | SIMD2 | SIMD1 (`<2×f32>`) |
| f32[3] | 12B | SIMD3 | SIMD2 |
| f32[4] | 16B | SIMD4 | SIMD2 |
| {f64,f64}/f64[2] | 16B | SIMD2 | SIMD2 |
| f64[3] | 24B | SIMD3 | **MEM** ← divergence |
| f64[4] | 32B | SIMD4 | **MEM** ← divergence |
| >4 f32 / f64[5+] | >16B | non-HFA (GP/by-ref) | MEM |
| {f32,f64} mixed-width | 16B | non-HFA (GP) | **SIMD2** (x64 only) |
| {f64,i64} | 16B | non-HFA (GP2) | SIMD1+GP1 (split) |
| nested {{f32,f32},f32} | 12B | SIMD3 (folded) | SIMD2 |
| overflow (members > free vN) | — | whole→MEM, sticky-close SIMD | whole→MEM (not sticky) |

Returns: aa64 HFA→v0..v[n-1]; x64 ≤16B all-SSE→XMM0/1, mixed→split, >16B→sret.

So the HFA predicate + placement is **per-CallConv/target** — gate a new
`cc.hfaMemberCount(t) → (n, memberTyp)` on the target (aa64 rule vs x64 rule),
returning 0 when not-HFA. Staging keeps x64's returning 0 until x64 is done, so a
partial aa64-only state never breaks x64.

## Verification (REPORT 3) — PROVEN, decisive

Pure-Binate tests can't detect this (self-consistent). `__c_call` can't pass structs
by value (`isCCompatibleArgType` rejects aggregates). The working mechanism: a
**clang C driver calls a native-compiled Binate HFA callee via its mangled symbol**.
Proven end-to-end: current compiler returns **0** (wrong) for `Hfa2(D2{3,7})→v.x*10+v.y`
on aa64 AND x64; scalar control + clang↔clang reference return **37** (correct). The
test FAILS pre-fix (0), PASSES post-fix (37).

Home: a `TestHfaCalleeFromC` in each backend's `*_test.bn`
(`pkg/binate/native/aarch64/aarch64_test.bn` + `x64/x64_test.bn`), which already
`clang`-link-and-run via `bootstrap.Exec` + `EmitObject` + `canLinkAndRun()`/
`findRuntimePath()`. Build IR module `main` with `Hfa2(v {f64,f64})→f64` = `v.x*10+v.y`,
`EmitObject`, write a C driver declaring `extern double bn_F1_4_main1_4_Hfa2(struct D2)`,
clang-link, assert stdout `37`. (Also cover an HFA *return* + a 3×f64 aa64 case + a
4×f32 case; x64 divergence: 3×f64 → MEM, verify it stays by-ref.)

## Staging (each stage: implement → the C-driver test fails-then-passes → commit on temp-4)

1. **aa64 HFA args** — `hfaMemberCountAa64` helper + classifier branch (gated aa64) +
   3 walkers advance-by-N + `aarch64_call.bn` caller N-reg placement +
   `aarch64_emit_func.bn` callee N-reg read. Verify: `TestHfaCalleeFromC` (aa64) 37.
2. **aa64 HFA return** — `FuncReturnsBigAggregate`/collect route HFA→v0..v[n-1] +
   `aarch64_return.bn` pack + caller collect. Verify: C driver reads an HFA return.
3. **x64 HFA args** — eightbyte classifier (all-SSE ≤16B → XMM; mixed split) +
   `x64_call.bn` + `x64_emit_func.bn`. Verify: TestHfaCalleeFromC (x64) 37 + 3×f64→MEM.
4. **x64 HFA return** — XMM0/1 pack + collect.
5. Wire the `TestHfaCalleeFromC` tests into the native unit suites; update
   claude-todo.md HFA item → done.

**Anti-hazard:** getting the classifier and the emitter to DISAGREE (one FP, one GP)
is a miscompile. Every stage must keep classifier + all 3 walkers + caller + callee
in lockstep, and the C-driver test (which crosses the ABI boundary) is the gate.

## Current state (2026-07-02) — stage 1 (aa64 HFA ARGS) LANDED

Landed on main as commit **`332b4298`** ("native/aa64: pass Homogeneous Floating-point
Aggregates in SIMD regs (AAPCS64)") — the dormant scaffolding + enable/fix squashed
into one coherent commit. `HfaAggregates = true` in `AAPCS64()`; the classifier +
walkers + aa64 caller/callee emitters are live.

- `common.bni`: `HfaAggregates bool` field + `func HfaClassify(t) (int, int)` decl.
- `common_callconv.bn`: `hfaFold` + `hfaMemberCount` + exported `HfaClassify`
  (returns memberCount, memberByteWidth); the HFA branch in `argRegWordsStackWords`;
  `advanceNsrn` helper (nsrn += N, sticky-close on overflow) wired into all 3
  walkers; the HFA exclusion in `advanceNgrn`.
- `aarch64_call.bn`: caller HFA branch (load member m from struct into a scratch,
  `Fmov_gp_to_fp` into `D0+nsrn+m`; overflow → whole struct to stack).
- `aarch64_emit_func.bn`: callee HFA branch — writes each member into the param's
  **data region** (`LookupAlloc`) at `dataOff + hfaW*m`, then publishes the
  data-region pointer into the 8-byte spill slot, mirroring the GP-passed aggregate
  path (overflow reads the incoming stack).

**THE BUG (root-caused + fixed).** The dormant code's callee branch wrote the incoming
float members straight into `LookupSpill(p.ID)`. For an *aggregate* param that 8-byte
slot holds a **pointer** to the data region, not the bytes (PlanFrame reserves a data
region + a pointer spill slot for every aggregate param; the GP path stores bytes to
the data region and writes the pointer to the spill slot). So the HFA branch (a)
overran the 8-byte slot with N members and (b) never set the pointer, so every
downstream aggregate consumer dereferenced raw float bits — a wrong value (0) across a
clang→native boundary, a SIGSEGV in pure-native dispatch (dereferencing `3.0`'s bits as
a pointer). The earlier "two hypotheses" were both off: the CALLER `X16` reuse is safe
(the per-arg `ResetRegs` keeps the pool below the X16/X17 fallback slots, so `ptr` from
`getOperand` is X9, never X16), and the param DID have a spill slot — it was the WRONG
slot to write to. Fix: write members to the data region and publish the pointer,
exactly like the GP aggregate path.

**Verification (all passing).**
- Cross-ABI C-driver (`/tmp/hfad`: `hfa_lib.bn` → `main.o`; `driver.c` clang-calling
  `bn_F1_4_main1_4_Hfa2(struct D2{double,double})`, linked as `clang -w driver.c
  main.o` — `main.o` has no undefined syms so no runtime needed): returns **37** (was
  **0**).
- Pure-native: 2/3/4-member float64 HFAs = 37 / 123 / 1234; mixed GP+scalar-float+HFA
  = 5837 (separate NGRN/NSRN counting correct).
- float32 HFA *passing* regression-free (field reads on 2×/3×/4×f32 = correct). Full
  float32 HFA *value* checks are blocked by a **separate CRITICAL** pre-existing
  float32 expression-typing miscompile (see claude-todo.md) — NOT an HFA bug.
- `pkg/binate/native/common` (156) + `pkg/binate/native/aarch64` (148) unit tests green.
- `conformance/963_hfa_struct_args` covers the float64 shapes across all backends
  (renumbered from 961 at land time — a concurrent worker took 961).
- Full native-aa64 conformance mode (`builder-comp_native_aa64-comp_native_aa64`) shows
  no HFA regression: the only failures are pre-existing intermittent `timeout 3`
  flakes (baseline fails a *different* test; none reproduce in isolation) — see the
  native-aa64 timeout-flake item in claude-todo.md.

**Next: stages 2–5** — aa64 HFA RETURN, x64 HFA args, x64 HFA return, then wire the
cross-ABI `TestHfaCalleeFromC` unit tests (the strongest gate; a pure-native/all-mode
conformance test like 963 can't catch a native+LLVM-agree-but-both-wrong case).
