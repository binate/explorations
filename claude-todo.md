### native aa64/arm32: a sub-word integer CALL RETURN is not canonicalized → wrong C-interop comparison — 🟠 IN PROGRESS (found 2026-07-15, func-value ABI interop review)

`aarch64.collectScalarReturn` (`aarch64_call.bn:380`) and arm32's `emitCallReturn`
scalar path (`arm32_call.bn:266`) spill the raw return register (`X0`/`R0`) with NO
sub-word sign/zero-extension.  x64 canonicalizes every sub-word call return via
`Movsx`/`Movzx`/`Movsxd` (`x64_call.bn:404-438`); aa64/arm32 never got the
equivalent.  Binate's OWN functions return a 64-bit-canonical sub-word (a Binate
`int8 -1` is `0xFFFF..FF`), so Binate↔Binate is masked — but a FOREIGN (C /
cross-ABI) callee follows AAPCS64 and returns only a 32-bit-extended value
(clang `signed char -1` → `mov w0,#-1` → `x0 = 0x00000000FFFFFFFF`).  Native code
then uses that raw register directly: `if c_signed_char_func() == -1` is FALSE on
aarch64 (confirmed: prints 0; the Binate↔Binate control prints 1).  Silent
wrong-code at the C-interop boundary.

Scope (empirically pinned): SIGNED `int8`/`int16` with the high bit set, from a
foreign callee, used DIRECTLY (comparison / 64-bit arithmetic), not through a
widening `cast` (the cast incidentally re-narrows).  int32 is SAFE on aa64 (compared
at 32-bit / re-narrowed — even a dirty-upper int32 return compares correctly), so it
must NOT be touched; unsigned is safe (clang zero-extends cleanly); x86-64 is immune.
Latent — no conformance test calls a C function returning a sub-word and compares it
(pure-Binate can't reproduce it: only a foreign callee returns a non-64-bit-canonical
sub-word).

Reframes the "cross-mode coerced-agg func-value ABI" item's sub-word-RETURN
follow-up, which was filed as "VM-only / cosmetic" — it is NOT: there is a reachable
NATIVE miscompile in the same class.

Fix: mirror x64 — in `collectScalarReturn` (aa64) / `emitCallReturn` scalar (arm32),
sign/zero-extend a sub-word integer return to the canonical width before the spill
store (aa64: `Sxtb`/`Sxth` / `Uxtb`/`Uxth`, retSz 1/2 only — leave 4; arm32:
`emitWidthExtend`, retSz 1/2).  Regression test must be an e2e C-interop test (a C
`signed char`/`int16` negative return, compared) run on native aa64 — pure Binate
cannot exercise it.

### native/arm32: `UnwrapNamed` should be `StripWrappers` at the 32-bit signedness / field-offset sites — 🟠 OPEN (found 2026-07-13, P5.2 shim-guard review)

P5.2 (`cc20fad0`) fixed the 64-bit value-SHAPE predicates (isReg64Scalar, isUnsigned64,
isFloatTyp, floatBitWidth) to peel ALL transparent wrappers via `types.StripWrappers`
(alias / readonly / named) instead of `common.UnwrapNamed` (named-only), because a
named-only peel classified a `readonly float64` / `readonly int64` scalar arg as NOT a
register pair → 1-word-placed → silent miscompile.  The SAME named-only-peel bug remains
in ~11 OTHER arm32-backend sites that make value-shape / signedness / offset decisions on
a possibly-wrapped type — all latent (no conformance test passes a readonly/alias-wrapped
value through them today), same root cause, each a potential silent wrong-code:
- **Signedness** (a `readonly uint32` / alias would be treated as SIGNED → wrong compare /
  div / shr): arm32_compare.bn:49 (isUnsigned in emitCompare), arm32_ops.bn:247 (isUnsigned
  in emitBinop div/rem/shr), and the sub-word signed/width reads at arm32_emit.bn:91,261.
- **Struct field OFFSET** (extracting a field from a `readonly`/alias-wrapped struct would
  mis-offset): arm32_emit.bn:84 (emitExtract), arm32_int64_mem.bn:94 (emitExtract64) — the
  latter specifically flagged by the P5.2 review as a would-mis-offset-an-int64-field case.
- **Cast src/target width**: arm32_ops.bn:377-378 (emitCast), arm32_int64_cast.bn:69,85,
  arm32_rodata.bn:44.

Fix: audit each site (grep `common.UnwrapNamed` in pkg/binate/native/arm32) and switch the
ones that make a value-shape/signedness/offset decision to `types.StripWrappers`; add a
conformance regression exercising a readonly/alias-wrapped unsigned compare + a wrapped
struct-field extract.  Verify no site legitimately WANTS the named-only peel first.

## CI red on main — release pre-check batch (found 2026-07-13)

Main's Unit / Conformance / E2E CI have been red for 1–2 weeks with UNTRACKED
failures; a 2026-07-13 release pre-check triaged all four red suites (latest
completed run on `57ef8be2`).  Per `release-process.md`, E2E / Conformance /
hygiene failures on modes that were green on the previous release BLOCK a release,
so these gate the next release.  The conformance one — the MAJOR
`1029_zero_size_struct_method` native miscompile — is now **FIXED & LANDED**
(`9cc0272a`; see the done log): the native backends counted a zero-size aggregate
as one argument word instead of zero, so a zero-size by-value receiver/arg read
from an uninitialized slot.  (Perf's red is a non-blocking infra gap — see the
native_x64-runner entry.)  Only Code hygiene is green.

### E2E red pile-up (6 failing scenarios) — 🔵 IN PROGRESS (found 2026-07-13)

E2E went green→red at `54aac72b` (2026-07-07) and accumulated failures as new
`e2e/*.sh` scripts landed (each runs the moment it lands; none tracked, and there
is no e2e xfail mechanism).  Latest run `57ef8be2` (29295407584) — six independent
failures:
- **split-paths (bnc leg)** — BUILDER-skew wrong IR: `pkg__builtins__rt.ll` icmp
  "'%vN' defined with type 'ptr' but expected 'i64'", clang fails.  The stale
  BUILDER's compiled-in codegen emits a mis-typed ptr/int compare for current
  rt.bn.  (See release-process.md "BUILDER-skew traps".)  → **RELEASE-RESOLVED**:
  pure BUILDER-skew — bumping `BUILDER_VERSION` to `bnc-0.0.11` (the release cycle)
  makes the BUILDER's codegen match current source; NO code fix needed.  Re-verify
  green after the bump (it also flips separate-compilation's BUILDER leg from SKIP
  to a real check).
- **separate-compilation (gen1 leg)** — `bnc --list-deps cmd/bnas` emits an
  `error:` line into stdout, polluting the dep loop → it tries to build a package
  literally named `error:` ("package \"error:\" not found").  Born red at
  `54aac72b`.  → Does NOT reproduce locally on macOS arm64: full
  `separate-compilation.sh` PASSES (gen1, 22 pkgs separately compiled + linked,
  byte-identical) and `--list-deps cmd/bnas` is clean (22 deps, empty stderr, no
  `error:`).  So this is x86_64-linux-specific or a bad-runner environmental —
  needs the x86_64 CI log to root-cause (bucket b).
- **ffi-export (--library leg)** — ✅ SKIPPED (`a7d4bb0e`).  NOT an archive-closure
  bug: the facade's closure references `bootstrap.Write` (via rt) + `bootstrap.Args`
  (via force-included startup), whose symbols are defined in `binate_runtime.c` —
  which the `--library` archive doesn't bundle and a C-owns-main driver can't link
  (binate_runtime.c has its own `main`).  The archive-build check stays; the
  C-driver link+run is SKIPPED pending the **Phase-6 runtime main-move** (move
  `main` out of `binate_runtime.c` → a main-less runtime the archive consumer can
  link).  Un-skip `check_library`'s link+run when the main-move lands (see the
  compiler-version-predicate / main-move entry below).
- **print-args (bni leg)** — ✅ DELETED (`a7d4bb0e`).  NOT a code bug: it tested
  `bootstrap.Args()` scoping under bni, which `8984ea2a` (2026-07-12) deliberately
  removed per design-os-args-vm.md (bootstrap.Args() diverging under the interpreter
  is ACCEPTED; programs use os.Args()).  Fully superseded by `os-args.sh` (the
  interpreter path via os.Args) + `conformance/487_bootstrap_args` (bootstrap.Args
  content, compiled).
- **cross-compile (ubuntu)** — ✅ FIXED (`20c7dbcd`).  NOT a missing package: the
  script's `clang_can_target` skip-probe compiled a HEADER-FREE TU, so it wrongly
  reported the aarch64 cross-libc present and the real build then failed on
  `bits/libc-header-start.h`.  The probe now `#include <stdio.h>` → ubuntu correctly
  SKIPs (macOS still runs via x86_64-darwin).  (Installing `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`
  on the runner would flip it to real ubuntu cross coverage — a separate CI choice.)
- **satentry-retention (ubuntu)** — 🔴 REAL x86_64-linux bug, OPEN.  CI job
  86971203015: the `native` arm's object is rejected by ld — `main.o: file format
  not recognized` → `linker command failed`.  The x64 NATIVE backend emits an object
  Linux ld can't read (likely Mach-O where ELF is expected, or malformed); the `llvm`
  arm passes.  Unreproducible on macOS.  Do NOT `xfail` — real native-backend defect,
  possibly related to the native_x64 issues above.

Status (2026-07-13): **print-args DELETED** + **ffi-export --library arm SKIPPED**
(`a7d4bb0e`), **e2e xfail/skip mechanism LANDED** (`4075eca1`), and **cross-compile
FIXED** (`20c7dbcd`, skip-probe).  **split-paths** is release-resolved (BUILDER
bump).  The CI-log pass (bucket b) found the last two are **REAL x86_64-linux bugs,
NOT infra** — so the mechanism is deliberately NOT applied to them (blind `xfail`
would mask real defects):
  - **separate-compilation** (CI job 86971203026) — `--list-deps cmd/bnas` emits an
    `error:` line to stdout on x86_64-linux (clean on macOS), polluting the dep loop.
  - **satentry-retention** — the native-backend `main.o` format bug above.
Both need an x86_64-linux repro (unavailable on the macOS dev host) — track as real
bugs, not gate-masking.

## Test-flake watch

Intermittent, load-/environment-dependent test failures tracked for recurrence —
NOT known defects and NOT critical.  Before treating a red one as a real
regression, **re-run the named test in isolation.**  Each entry notes the date(s)
observed.

### `spec/11-interfaces/052_alias_same_identity` — suspected environmental one-off (observed 2026-07-10)

One failure during a saturated multi-mode `builder-comp` sweep; passed 3/3 in
isolation and clean in the concurrent `builder-comp-comp` run. The test is
deterministic (exact `"ok"`), `builder-comp` has no per-test timeout, and tests
run sequentially within a mode — so the lone red was almost certainly a transient
OS-level hiccup under load, not a real defect. A recurrence will reveal it.

### arm32 iface shape-test intermittent LP64-doubling flake (observed 2026-07-06) — suspected REAL bug, needs investigation

`TestEmitImplVtables{NonExtending,ExtendedConcat}Shape` (`arm32_iface_test.bn`)
~1/50 in the full ordered native unit run (never in `--run` isolation) fail relro
byte-counts with EXACTLY LP64-doubled values (24→48, 72→144) — ILP32 `IntSize=4`
not in effect at emit. Root cause UNKNOWN (target-global leak or a real gen1
emission-nondeterminism bug); guard `3ca73110` pins it, and do NOT widen the tolerance.

## Language features — specified, not yet implemented

### Type assertions, type switches & RTTI — ✅ COMPLETE — one optional, deferred tightening

The whole feature (RTTI substrate + front-end: `x.(K T)`, comma-ok, type
switches, the §17.5 panic, the cross-mode/VM story) **and** the design-D
TypeInfo-registry migration are landed and conformance-green in every mode; the
spec Draft banners are flipped.  See the done log for the full record.  One
optional residual:

**🔧 Optional tightening (deferred, low value).** Make the design-D registry the
*single seam* that BOTH `collectImplVtableSlots` (vtable slot-1) and
`BuildTypeInfo` read, so the "record symbol == slot reference" invariant holds by
construction instead of via two independent `mangle.TypeInfoName` call sites.  A
separate, later step — a robustness nicety, not a correctness fix.

## Method values & function values (codegen)

### cross-mode coerced-agg func-value ABI — residual native-shim follow-ups
The cross-mode coerced-aggregate-ARG residuals — the iface/func-value by-address
fix, the >7-arg extern guard, and the sub-word/bool RETURN — LANDED via the by-address
ABI rework (`233cc82d`) + the >7-arg guard (`17cfc16b`); see claude-todo-done.md. An
observable native-struct-return-into-by-value-extern fixture (`dd3d8b59`) landed too.
Smaller follow-ups remain:

1. **shim-extends RETURN (cleanup, optional).** The sub-word RETURN was fixed VM-side
   (the 25117a2e VM-narrow mechanism extended to iface/func-value), since the sub-word/bool
   RETURN concern is VM-only. The review's cleaner shim-extends design (every backend's shim
   sext/zext's sub-word returns; drop the VM narrow) is deferred — a multi-backend,
   target-word-dependent change with a tail-branch→call-shape wrinkle.  Plan +
   per-backend shim sites + verification: [plan-funcvalue-shim-extend.md](plan-funcvalue-shim-extend.md).

(The x64 closure-shim soft-length split and the conditional func-value spill staging are
✅ DONE & LANDED — see claude-todo-done.md.)

See explorations/plan-funcvalue-byaddr-abi.md.

## Cross-mode interface dispatch & compiler/interpreter interop

### MINOR — cross-mode interface dispatch: residual LP64-host latent gap (2026-06-14) — 🟡 OPEN

The shim-route that dispatches a native-only package's interface methods from
bytecode (landed `93f75f27` + the math/big extension `7c3b17a2`) is exercised by
726 (`strings.Builder` via `io.Writer`: a raw-slice arg, a scalar arg, a no-arg
method; scalar + multi-return) and 577 (`errors.Error`: no-arg, multi-return).
An adversarial review found four more shapes UNTESTED — each needed a SYNTHETIC
native-only test package, since no stdlib impl hits them. ✅ NOW COVERED by
`e2e/xmiface.sh` (main `7f15b1e9`, 2026-07-01): a custom host injects a fixture
package's `__Package()` into the VM inject-set (`Interp.isCompiled` → its impls
dispatch natively) while the dispatching main runs as bytecode —

- A VALUE-receiver iface method (the iv-dispatch thunk deref; `a0` = the iv-data
  ptr the thunk derefs; 410 covered native-to-native only) — `Double()` → 42.
- A method with MULTIPLE aggregate args (the `a1/a2` by-address slots) —
  `Combine(Pair,Pair)` → 110.
- A FLOAT arg (the shim's int-slot → FP bitcast path) — `Scale(2.5)` → 20.
- The `n>6` user-arg overflow guard (a negative test) — the loud vmPanic, which,
  being specific to the cross-mode path, also proves the fixture is genuinely
  native-injected (a bytecode-lowered fixture would print 28, not panic).

Residuals (still open):

Latent, LP64-host-only (NOT active — default VM modes run a 64-bit host):
- `dispatchCompiledIfaceMethod`'s `resultSize > 8` aggregate-vs-scalar threshold
  (and `dispatchExternBinding`'s identical one) must track `isAggregateReturn`'s
  `> target.PointerSize`; on an ILP32 VM host a 5–8-byte aggregate return would
  pick the wrong shim shape. (Now commented in `vm_exec_iface.bn`.)
- 64-bit-scalar args pack as 2 slots on a 32-bit host (`argSlots`); the dispatch
  reads them as positional shim args.

Separately (was PRE-EXISTING): the native backend GP-coerced HFAs (a struct of ≤4
same-kind floats) instead of SIMD-passing them — a latent ABI-nonconformance
reachable only at a cross-ABI / cross-mode boundary. **RESOLVED**: HFA-in-SIMD landed
on both backends (aa64 `48e3787b`, x64 `ce759c41`) as the coordinated cross-backend
project it needed to be — LLVM codegen + both native backends + the dispatch shims +
the VM cross-mode boundary now classify HFAs identically (tests `968`–`971`). See the
done log, "HFA-in-SIMD is a CROSS-BACKEND contract". (The old "`e2e/xmiface` tested
only a scalar float, not an HFA struct" concern is moot — `969_hfa_dispatch` covers
HFA structs through the func-value / closure / interface dispatch kinds, run
cross-mode in the `-int` modes.)

### Package descriptors (Phase B) — `__Package()` works in compiled + VM modes (builtins); general Functions-table still future
- **Status**: compiled-mode AND VM-mode `__Package()` landed (binate
  `feadde2c`, VM-mode for the builtin packages).  The general interop
  Functions-table (user packages, auto-enumeration) remains future work.
- **What works (compiled mode)**: every package emits an immortal
  static-managed `reflect.Package` descriptor node + a generated
  `__Package() @reflect.Package` accessor (codegen `emit_pkg_descriptor.bn`,
  via the static-managed emitter).  The type checker synthesizes the
  `__Package` signature at selector resolution (`check_expr_access.bn`
  `packageAccessorType`), IR-gen registers it as an imported extern so calls
  resolve + a `declare` emits (`gen_import.bn`), and `reflect` is force-loaded
  (`ensureReflectLoaded`).  Drives a real immortal node through the compiled
  RefInc/RefDec sentinel end-to-end (see [`plan-static-managed-sentinel.md`]).
- **What works (VM mode, binate `feadde2c`)**: the earlier "Functions-table
  is genuinely required" finding was too pessimistic.  `__Package` is already
  a real exported per-module symbol, and the IR/func-value path already
  mangles a qualified `pkg.__Package` reference to call it — so the only
  blocker was the type checker rejecting `_func_handle(pkg.__Package)` (it's
  compiler-synthesized, not a `SYM_FUNC` in scope).  Two small changes wired
  it: (1) `types/check_builtin.bn` accepts `pkg.__Package` as a `_func_handle`
  argument by name; (2) `vm/extern_register_std.bn`
  `registerPackageDescriptorExterns` binds the builtin packages' `__Package`
  (rt, libc, bootstrap, reflect) as VM externs.  Interpreted `pkg.__Package()`
  now dispatches through the func-value shim to the real accessor, and the
  returned `@reflect.Package` is RefDec-safe via the static-managed sentinel —
  exercising the sentinel end-to-end in interpreted mode too.
- **Coverage**: `conformance/532_reflect_package_accessor`
  (`rt.__Package().Name` → "pkg/builtins/rt") now green in ALL 6 default modes
  (the 3 VM-mode xfails removed).
- **Still future — the general Functions-table**
  ([`notes-package-introspection.md`](notes-package-introspection.md) Phase B):
  `registerPackageDescriptorExterns` is a hand-maintained precursor covering
  only the builtins compiled INTO the host binary (their `__Package` is a real
  symbol the shim can call).  USER packages run as interpreted bytecode and
  have no `__Package` body — those need the real table: codegen emits a
  per-package `Functions` table (name + signature + function-value per
  exported func), and the VM auto-enumerates all packages' tables (the
  cross-package registry, open Q4 in the notes — likely a linker section with
  start/stop symbols) to bind names → function values, replacing the hand-
  maintained `RegisterStandardExterns` entirely.  Then richer type metadata
  (Phase C) for reflection/printing + RTTI for type assertions.
- **Linter caveat (see "bnlint typechecks dependency bodies" + lint-skip
  entries)**: `registerPackageDescriptorExterns` is the first `__Package`
  reference in *linted* source, which the BUILDER-bundled bnlint can't yet
  typecheck — `scripts/hygiene/lint.sh` temporarily skips pkg/binate/vm +
  pkg/binate/repl + cmd/bni until the next BUILDER bump.

### Compiler/interpreter interop — MAJOR PROJECT — 🟢 substrate + descriptor LANDED; general user-package table remains (Phase B)

Dual-mode execution substrate is LANDED: shared-layout/refcount cross-mode interop, function values (`{vtable,data}` rep + shims + `dispatchCompiledFuncValue`), the `reflect.Package`/`__Package()` descriptor (compiled + VM builtins, `conformance/532` green in all 6 modes), cross-mode dispatch coverage, and the VM name→function-value registry (`registerPackageDescriptorExterns`).

Remaining (LIVE tracker is the "Package descriptors (Phase B)" entry above): the GENERAL Functions-table for USER packages — codegen emits a per-package `Functions` table + the VM auto-enumerates all packages via a cross-package registry, replacing hand-maintained `RegisterStandardExterns` (now down to ~11 `RegisterExtern` arms; `vm_extern` dispatch is already table-driven); then Phase C richer type metadata / RTTI.

Dormant cross-mode func-value residual (folded in from the retired "Function values — residual follow-ups" entry): the one trampoline ARG shape not yet covered is **float args in V/FP registers** — nothing reaches it today (float scalars ride the integer banks; aggregate returns use `TrampolineAggregate`, ILP32 i64 returns use `TrampolineScalar64`, and >7 args fail loud by design, `17cfc16b`). Add a float-V-reg trampoline if/when a path actually needs it.

(Background/history archived in claude-todo-done.md.)

### Embeddable-interp — open follow-ups (Inc 2 extern cleanup core landed) — 🟡 OPEN (2026-06-20)

The embeddable-interp core (Inc 1, Inc 2 Layers 1/2 + the review (b)-fix, and the
loader de-rooting) is **✅ DONE & LANDED** — full detail in
[claude-todo-done.md](claude-todo-done.md). Plan:
[`plan-embeddable-interp.md`](plan-embeddable-interp.md). Remaining open
follow-ups (deferred with user sign-off):

(The interpreted-`__c_call` frontend guards — run/REPL `da3bd46a` and `--test`-path
`1de21404` — landed and moved to [claude-todo-done.md](claude-todo-done.md).)

- **Globals/vtables-sensitive inject-set test.** `TestNewCustomPkgsRespected`
  proxies on `len(Externs)` (function registration only); add a test that a
  custom set's globals + impl vtables are honored (the `errors.Is`
  sentinel-identity path).
- **Layer 2b — `@reflect.Package` wrapping helper.** Build a modified descriptor
  from an existing one with selected `FunctionInfo` values replaced, so an
  embedder overrides e.g. `os.Args()` without hand-constructing a descriptor.
  This is the ergonomic per-function override path; it also rehomes the
  `progArgsAfterDash` Args shim (becomes a cmd/bni-built wrapped-`os` concern
  rather than baked into interp's bootstrap registration). Land with an
  end-to-end test proving a wrapped package changes observed runtime behavior.
- Optional: auto-enumerate bootstrap's exported format helpers via
  `RegisterPackageFunctions` (they qualify — exported, non-extern), leaving only
  the 9 extern C-I/O entries hand-bound.

## VM runtime faults & the rt.Exit/abort/panic paradigm

### rt.Abort/rt.Panic Plan 2 — make user-code VM faults recoverable (host survives) — 🟡 SCOPE REQUIRED (2026-06-20)

**Related robustness gap (filed 2026-06-30):** a bad-pointer deref inside a NATIVE EXTERN
called from the VM (e.g. handing a wild pointer to `rt.Refcount`) SIGSEGVs the VM host with
NO guard — it is not one of the 6 guarded VM user-fault sites (bounds/divide/shift/nil-deref/
stack-overflow/call-through-nil), and there is no signal handler in `pkg/binate/vm` / `cmd/bni`
/ `rt`. Surfaced while resolving the "VM refcount halt" probe-artifact (see done file). If
this VM-fault-recovery work is picked up, the native-extern boundary should be considered too.

Plan doc: [`plan-rt-abort-panic.md`](plan-rt-abort-panic.md). **Plan 1 (the
`rt.Abort`/`rt.Panic` primitives, the `panic()` single-string + lowering change,
and the VM internal-abort migration through `panic()`) is DONE & LANDED** — see
claude-todo-done.md.

User-code runtime faults (bounds / divide / shift / nil-deref / stack-overflow /
call-through-nil) should be RECOVERABLE in the VM (the host REPL / test-runner /
embedder survives a bad interpreted program) while staying fatal in compiled
code. The 6 VM user-fault sites are deliberately still on `rt.Exit(1)` pending
this. Approach (per user): rt is already injected into the VM, so a faulting user
op already calls the *injected* `rt.Panic`/`rt.Abort`; inject a VM-specific
variant that unwinds the VM's DATA-stack frames (`vm.Stack`) back to `CallFunc`
instead of killing the host (no longjmp — the user call stack is data, not the
host stack). Open: the exec-loop unwind mechanism + refcount-correct frame
teardown.

Related smaller follow-up: route panic / `runtime error:` / VM diagnostics to
**stderr** (fd 2) — deferred out of Plan 1 (infra exists: `bootstrap.Write(fd)`,
`bootstrap.STDERR = 2`); a real behavior change for anything scraping them off
stdout.

### `rt.Exit` paradigm: `exit` vs `abort`/`panic` — DISCUSS
- `rt.Exit` (→ libc `exit`) is the wrong model in general: process exit
  is meaningless in an embedded/freestanding environment, and the
  runtime mostly invokes it for *abort* conditions (OOM, bounds-fail,
  refcount corruption). `abort`/`panic` is likely the right paradigm.
- Surfaced 2026-06-03 alongside the `__c_call`/drop-libc work; that
  change preserves `Exit`→`exit` behavior, so this is a clean,
  independent follow-up. Needs a design discussion before any change.

## 32-bit-host toolchain: IR constant width & VM machine word

### `lowerFromSource` / `genModule` test helpers pass a NIL checker → int literals > INT32_MAX truncate on a 32-bit host — 🟠 OPEN (found 2026-07-04)

`pkg/binate/vm/lower_test.bn`'s `lowerFromSource` (and `genModule`) create a
checker (`c.Check(file)`) but then call `ir.GenModule(nil, file)` — passing `nil`
instead of `c`. With a nil `ctx.Checker`, `exprIntLitValue` (`gen_expr.bn:66`)
falls back to `parseIntLit` instead of the checker's bignum (LitMag/LitSign), so a
source literal exceeding the IR-gen HOST's signed-int range wraps: on the
arm32 unit-test binary (host int = 32-bit at IR-gen time), `5000000000` →
`705032704`, `2147483648` → wraps. This is a TEST-HELPER bug (real programs go
through `cmd/bnc`/`cmd/bni` with a real checker), but it makes any
`lowerFromSource`/`compileAndRun`-based test with a `> INT32_MAX` literal FAIL on
arm32 — it masqueraded as a "reverse-fix truncation" until isolated (the real fix
is correct; the test now builds via direct IR `EmitConstInt64`). Fix: pass `c` to
`GenModule` in both helpers (they already have it). Likely turns 1–2 of the arm32
vm-unit reds below green.

### arm32 `builder-comp_arm32_linux vm` unit package: 6 PRE-EXISTING failures exposed once it compiles — 🟠 OPEN (found 2026-07-04)

The literal-unblock commit (`5b557686`) makes the arm32 vm-unit package COMPILE
(it previously didn't, hiding all failures). 236 pass, 6 fail — all pre-existing,
unrelated to the 64-bit-return work:
- `TestExecUint32HighBitToFloat32`, `TestLowerCastUint32ZeroExtendsToUint64` —
  likely the nil-checker helper bug above (`2147483648` / `4294967295` literals).
- `TestRegisterPackageFunctionsCarriesRetbufSize` (hardcodes managed-slice `32`),
  `TestLowerReturnSingleFuncValue` (hardcodes func-value `16`) — hardcoded LP64
  sizes; fix to `types.GetTarget().PointerSize`-derived.
- `TestExecBcIfaceUpcastNativeSource` (hardcodes upcast `offset*8`),
  `TestVtableInjectRegistry` — fallout from the concurrent `0734beaa` iface
  vtable-any-block change; likely that lane's to resolve.
Per red-mode-first: each needs a target-aware fix or an xfail+TODO.

### `data_pkg_descriptor.bn` header/slice-width conflation — 🟢 LOW (non-urgent cleanup)
The `GetTarget().IntSize` "footgun" was a MISDIAGNOSIS and the native-accessor header reads
were switched to `ManagedHeaderSize()` (main `581216d9`) — see [claude-todo-done.md](claude-todo-done.md).
Residual: `data_pkg_descriptor.bn` (IR-gen phase) still uses one int-sized `w` for BOTH the
managed-header words (pointer-sized) AND slice lengths (int-sized) — a documented "assumes
PointerSize==IntSize" conflation, harmless on every shipping ABI. Untangle header (→
`ManagedHeaderSize`/ptrSize) from slice-length (→ IntSize) only if a wide-int ILP32 ABI is targeted.

**Do NOT mistake this for a quick width-swap.** Two reasons it stays deferred, not just small:
(1) **Untestable until a `ptr≠int` target exists** — every current ABI has PointerSize==IntSize
(LP64 8/8, ILP32 4/4), so the emitted bytes are byte-identical before/after on every backend and
mode; no test can distinguish a correct fix from a buggy one, and this is a memory-layout contract
(both backends emit it, `reflect.Package` readers consume it) — the worst place for a silent,
unverifiable error. (2) **A correct version needs explicit padding, not just widths** — the payload
is four raw slices `{data: ptr, len: int}`; when `ptr≠int` each `len` no longer fills to the next
pointer's alignment, so `DataZero` padding terms are required between `len` and the next `data` (the
current flat-`DataTerm` sequence emits none, relying on `2*w` spacing). Do it WHEN a wide-int ABI is
built, together with a test that exercises `ptr≠int` (the only thing that validates it).

## Slimming `pkg/bootstrap`; C interop (`__c_call`)

### aarch64-linux **native** conformance mode (e2e for the aarch64 ELF relocs) — 🟢 MODE LANDED (`e8c99290`, 2026-07-09); residuals below

The native aarch64 **ELF** data + GOT relocations (`ADD_ABS_LO12_NC`,
`LDST64_ABS_LO12_NC`, `ADR_GOT_PAGE`, `LD64_GOT_LO12_NC`) landed in `9e866a43`
— fixing a MAJOR silent-`R_AARCH64_NONE` miscompile (see `claude-todo-done.md`)
— were clang-byte-verified (`objdump`) + unit-tested but **not link+run-verified**.
The `builder-comp_native_aa64_linux-comp_native_aa64_linux` mode (`e8c99290`)
now closes that: gen1 compiles each test `--backend native --target aarch64-linux`
and runs it under qemu-aarch64 on the x86_64 CI runner (`gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`
cross-libc + `qemu-user-static`), analogous to the x64-linux `builder-comp_native_x64`
runner. It exercises the aarch64 ELF path — and the `__c_global` §5b GOT lowering
— end-to-end. Wired **experimental** (continue-on-error) in
`.github/workflows/conformance-tests.yml`.

**Residuals (🟡 OPEN):**
1. **First-CI-run triage — 1st pass done, awaiting a clean run.** The debut run
   (push `e8c99290`) reported 492 pass / 2203 fail, but ~all failures were one
   runner bug — `qemu-aarch64-static: Could not open '/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1'`
   (dynamically-linked binaries; qemu-user looked for the loader on the host, not
   the cross sysroot). Fixed by `QEMU_LD_PREFIX=/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu` in the
   runner (`2f97732b`), mirroring arm32_linux. The NEXT CI run is what shows the
   aarch64 native backend's real pass/fail once the loader resolves → then compute
   the xfail set / fix real bugs → drop `experimental` once green. Not runnable on
   the macOS dev host (no aarch64-linux cross-libc / qemu).
2. **Native arm64 runner via a cross-compiled `linux-arm64` bundle (option 1) —
   🟢 plumbing + release-wiring LANDED; awaiting a release cut, then a runner.**
   Done: `build-{bnc,bni,bnas,bnlint,bnfmt}.sh` + `make-bundle.sh` gained a
   `--target`/non-host-`--platform` cross-compile path (`ec421c0b`) — Stage 1
   (BUILDER→gen1) stays host, Stage 2 cross-emits — and `release.yml` gained a
   `linux-arm64` matrix row that cross-builds on the x86_64 runner via the
   existing `bnc-0.0.10-linux-x64` BUILDER + `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` (`b32c53c9`),
   breaking the chicken-and-egg. Validated end-to-end on macos-arm64→macos-x64
   (Rosetta), guarded by `e2e/cross-compile.sh`. **Remaining (🟡 OPEN):** (a) no
   `linux-arm64` bundle is PUBLISHED yet — it needs a `bnc-*` release cut (the
   next release will build it; deliberately not cut yet); (b) once published, a
   native `ubuntu-*-arm` conformance runner (fetch-builder pulling the arm64
   bundle) could replace the current qemu-aarch64 mode from residual (1)'s
   `builder-comp_native_aa64_linux`.

### Slim `pkg/bootstrap` toward retirement — 🟡 OPEN

**`pkg/libc` is GONE** (retired: Memcpy/Memset became pure-Binate byte loops;
Malloc/Calloc/Free, Exit, and the rest all migrated out — see the done log / git
history). **`pkg/bootstrap` is now seriously slimmed** — only four things remain,
and they all hang off `print`/`println`:

- **`Write()`** — the raw stdout/stderr sink, called internally by `print`/`println`.
- **the "private" format helpers** (`formatInt`/`formatInt64`/`formatUint`/
  `formatBool`/`formatFloat`) — also `print`/`println` internals.
- **`Args()`** — process argv; not yet replaced (no libc fn returns argv, so a
  minimal platform hook is unavoidable).
- **`Exec()`** — subprocess spawn; not yet replaced.

**Actionable plan (what's left to retire bootstrap):**
1. **Replace `Exec()`** with an equivalent in `pkg/std/os`.
2. **Support `Args()`** in `pkg/std/os` + `pkg/builtins/rt` (or similar) — decide
   where the argv hook lives (it can't be pure `__c_call`; a minimal platform hook
   is required).
3. **Deprecate `print`/`println`.** They are the *only* remaining users of
   `Write()` and the private format helpers, so retiring them frees the entire
   rest of bootstrap's surface.

**Residual (small, separable):** wire `ensureLangLoaded` + `appendLangImport` into
the repl's import setup (`pkg/binate/repl/{ir_imports,session,util}.bn`) so
`myInt.String()` works at the repl too — the rest of the "primitive `.String()`
without importing `lang`" work is done (compiled + VM).

**Constraints (still apply):** migrate callers OUT — never rename bootstrap's
C-symbol-resolved I/O in place. An in-place rename hits a Stage-1 link wall (gen1
links BUILDER's *pinned* runtime, which only defines the OLD mangled I/O symbols),
and any change that adds/removes `bn_pkg__bootstrap__*` runtime defs is a
runtime-ABI change → **BUILDER-bump-gated**. `__c_call` is scalar/pointer-only, so
slice-taking / aggregate-returning I/O needs marshalling (cstr, data-ptr,
aggregate build).

(VM Phase 1 is DONE — bootstrap is native-only in the VM, format helpers
registered as externs; main `a7fabc7a` + `7abc3809`. The older "convert bootstrap
I/O to `.bn` + `__c_call`" Phase 2 is superseded by the plan above: `pkg/std/os`
subsumes the I/O, so there's no reason to convert it in place. Design notes:
`plan-bootstrap-ccall.md`.)

### Annotations & C function interop — `__c_call` DONE; residual is the `#[link]` companion — 🟡 OPEN (low)

**Option E (`__c_call` intrinsic) was chosen (form E2) and is ✅ DONE & SHIPPED**
(incl. native variadics; `plan-c-call.md` = "COMPLETE, 2026-06-02"). Call sites use
`result = __c_call("write", int32, cast(int32, fd), buf, len)` — C symbol name +
explicit return type + args already in the Binate types matching the C ABI, reusing
the backends' platform-C-ABI lowering (no C parsing, no `bn_` mangling). It is in
production across `pkg/builtins/rt` + `pkg/std/os` (open/read/stat/readdir/errno…),
retiring `pkg/bootstrap`'s hand-written C wrappers as intended. The general `#[…]`
annotation syntax also landed (as `#[build(…)]`). Options A–D and the E1
(C-prototype-string) form were rejected — see `plan-c-call.md` / git for that history.

**Chose NOT to build: the `pkg/c` C-types alias package** (`C_int`/`C_long`/
`C_size_t`/…). Call sites open-code the Binate↔C scalar correspondence directly
(`int32`, `*uint8`, `uint`, …). Revisit only if that open-coding becomes a real
maintenance pain. (`__c_call` stays compiled-mode-only; interpreted-mode use is a
frontend error — VM/dual-mode FFI dispatch is a separate deferred item.)

**Residual — the companion `#[link]` link-requirement annotation (sketch, NOT
built).** `__c_call` makes a C symbol *callable*; a complementary annotation would
make it *resolve at link time* — declare at the source level (most naturally in the
`.bni`, since the link requirement is part of the package's contract) that a package
needs some C library linked, so the driver adds the flag automatically instead of
every consumer passing `--cflag -lm` / `--link-after-objs` by hand. Prior art: Rust
`#[link(name="m")]`, Go cgo `#cgo LDFLAGS`, MSVC `#pragma comment(lib,…)`. Natural
shape `#[link("m")]` (optional `static`/`dynamic`/`framework` kind). This is the
first real payoff of the general annotations feature. Open wrinkles:
- **Transitivity** — propagate + dedup declared libs through the import graph (hook
  the loader's `ldr.Order` walk + the driver's `clangArgs` assembly).
- **Link ordering** — static archives supply only symbols referenced by *earlier*
  inputs, so aggregated `-l` entries need correct placement vs the `.o`s + runtime
  (the driver already does this for `linkAfterObjs`).
- **Platform-conditionality** — a `libm` dep is meaningless on bare-metal and
  `framework` kind is macOS-only, so the annotation likely needs target-qualification
  (ties into the C-free principle: it should evaporate on freestanding targets).
- **Static-spec portability** — `kind=static` is messy to express portably (GNU ld
  `-l:libfoo.a` / `-Wl,-Bstatic`; macOS `ld` has neither) → per-platform driver
  lowering or a full-path escape hatch.
- **Search paths** — keep the annotation name-only (`-l`); leave `-L<dir>` to flags.

### FFI **export** (`#[c_export]`) — expose Binate to C — 🟡 OPEN (proposal, not ratified)

The outbound counterpart to `__c_call`/`__c_global`: expose Binate functions **to** C,
and write the program's startup glue in Binate. **Design (proposal, reworked +
adversarially reviewed, NOT specified/implemented):**
[design-ffi-export.md](design-ffi-export.md). **High-level implementation roadmap:**
[plan-ffi-export.md](plan-ffi-export.md). Scope: a `#[c_export("name")]` annotation
(additional unmangled C symbol; no grammar change); hardcoded well-known `bn_init`
(build-root-rooted, idempotent — the promotion of `main.__init_all`) / `bn_entry`; a
new `pkg/builtins/platform_init` package of build-conditional entry functions that
**retires `runtime/binate_runtime.c`**; a `bnc --library`/merge build mode; a
trivial-forward→symbol-alias optimization; a header generator; a baremetal
linker-placement annotation. **Phase 0 is a user decision** (ratify + spec before
building); MVP path is plan Phases 1→2→3→5a. Motivating use case = the embeddable
interpreter/VM (`plan-embeddable-interp.md` / `plan-embeddable-vm.md`); sibling to the
`#[link]` companion above (same annotation family).

## Build constraints (`#[build(EXPR)]`)


### Build constraints (`#[build(EXPR)]`) — deferred follow-ups (arch/os MVP landed) — 🟡 OPEN
The `#[build(EXPR)]` arch/os MVP is landed at all four granularities (file / decl / import / `.bni`),
host-default config overridable per `--target`, through `c7249552` (conformance 731/733/735/736/737/746/747);
full design in [`plan-build-constraints.md`](plan-build-constraints.md), archived in
[claude-todo-done.md](claude-todo-done.md). Still deferred (none started):
- Vocabulary beyond arch/os: `triple` / `backend` / `libc` / `ptrsize` / `version` with `is` / `at_least` / `at_most`.
  (The **`version`** slice is now designed + planned — see the dedicated entry below.)
- `bnlint --target`; main-module gating; migrating the `impls/` duplicate trees onto constraints.
- The separate inline-asm (`#[asm]`) doc that composes with this substrate.

### Compiler-version predicate for `#[build]` — 🟢 MACHINERY LANDED (`dedbb620`, 2026-07-13); main-move remains
The `#[build]` compiler-version gate — `at_least`/`at_most`/`is(version, "X.Y.Z")`
(strict `X.Y.Z[-pre[N]]`, `-pre` stripped, numeric compare) + `BuildConfig.Version`
— is **landed** (`dedbb620`; version-format hyphenation + `version-sync` check
`e31750b8`) and **spec'd** (§16.8 `pkg.build` / `pkg.build.version`). Design/status:
[plan-build-version-predicate.md](plan-build-version-predicate.md).

**Remaining — the main-move it exists for (gated behind a BUILDER re-pin):** re-pin
BUILDER to a version understanding `at_least`; then bump the tree version and gate
`startup`'s `#[c_export("main")]` on `at_least(version, <threshold>)` + delete the
tree's `binate_runtime.c` `main` (BUILDER excludes it → bundle `main`; gen1 includes
it → tree `main`; motivation: FFI-export Phase 6 / design-ffi-export.md §3.3). When
it lands, un-skip `e2e/ffi-export.sh`'s `check_library` link+run (skipped in
`a7d4bb0e`). BUILDER constraint: no `#[build(at_least(…))]` in `cmd/bnc`'s own tree
until the re-pin (mirrors `#[c_export]`).

## bnfmt (self-hosted formatter)

## bnlint rules, unused-entity checks & lint skips

### `LINT_SKIP` — CHECK_TOOLS-lag on the injectable-key-policy + Table container packages — 🟡 OPEN

Main's `scripts/hygiene/lint.sh` skips exactly these from bnlint style checks:
`pkg/stdx/{hash,cmp}` and `pkg/stdx/containers/{table,mapfn,setfn,hashmap,set}`
(all on main, under `ifaces/stdlib/` + `impls/stdlib/`). The `bnc-0.0.11pre2`
bnlint (fetched via CHECK_TOOLS_VERSION) mis-fires the generic constraint check at
their blanket impls — false "type argument H does not satisfy constraint
Hasher[T]" / "K does not satisfy Hashable" — because the checker fixes `2f8969e8` /
`6647c49f` postdate the pre2 bundle. A current-source bnlint lints them clean, and
every conformance mode still fully type-checks + compiles them. **Drop at the next
CHECK_TOOLS bump past `6647c49f`** (lint.sh's own comment tracks the same condition).

### `unused-func` false-positives on an all-`.bni` (all-generic) package's exported API — 🟠 OPEN (found 2026-07-14, examples repo bnc-0.0.11 bump)

`bnc-0.0.11`'s new `unused-func` rule flags EVERY exported function of an
all-`.bni` package (generic bodies in the `.bni`, no `.bn` — e.g. the
`examples/generics/pkg/{vec,sort,hashmap}` libraries: `New`, `Push`, `Items`, …)
as "unused function", though they are the package's public API.

Root cause: `unused_func.bn:97` exempts exported funcs (`if d.Exported { return
false }`), and the loader's `markBniExportedFuncs` (`loader_util.bn:214`) is meant
to set `Exported=true` on every merged `DECL_FUNC` whose name appears in the
`.bni` — its own comment explicitly calls out the prepended generic/extern func
decls. But on **bnlint's** lint path that flag is NOT set for an all-`.bni`
package, so the rule treats the public API as unexported dead code. (Likely bnlint
builds the `merged` AST it lints without running `markBniExportedFuncs`, or
`sameFuncDecl` fails to match a generic signature — needs pinpointing.) The
ordinary case — sig in `.bni`, body in `.bn` — is marked correctly and is NOT
flagged, which is why only all-`.bni` packages trip it (`unused-global` /
`unused-type` avoid this by checking `.bni`-membership directly rather than the
`Exported` flag: `unused_type.bn`'s `isExportedType`, `unused_global.bn`).

Repro: `bnlint pkg/vec` (no `--tests`) on an all-generic library → every exported
func flagged. `bnlint --tests …` HIDES it (test roots reach the funcs) but only
when the API is fully test-covered; an untested exported generic func in an
all-`.bni` package would still be false-flagged.

Discovered bumping `examples` to `bnc-0.0.11`; worked around there by running
`bnlint --tests` in its `lint.sh` (also the correct config independently). Proper
fix: ensure `Exported` is set for all-`.bni`-package funcs on bnlint's lint path,
or have `unused-func` treat a `.bni`-declared func as exported (mirror
`unused_type`/`unused_global`). Add a bnlint unit test: an all-`.bni` generic
package's exported func must NOT be flagged `unused-func`.

### Raw-slice escape: decide whether a BROADER best-effort escape lint is wanted — 🟡 NEEDS DECISION
The original framing ("demote the raw-slice escape TYPE ERROR to a linter rule")
is obsolete: there is NO type-check rejection for raw-slice escape (the checker
never rejected it), and a `raw-slice-return` LINT rule already exists (`lint.bn`,
landed `10d19369`) — but it only covers the `@[]T → *[]T` "drops the managed
wrapper" return case. **Open decision (user):** is a broader best-effort escape
lint wanted (return / store-to-outliving-field / assign-to-global of a raw slice
borrowing a local), or is the current narrow rule + "raw is an opt-in escape
hatch" sufficient (close this out)?

## Hygiene checks: tier dependencies & file length

### Lower the file-length `.bni` cap toward 1000/1200 — 🟡 OPEN
- **Residual** of the (now-archived) "Extend hygiene checks to scan `ifaces/`+`impls/`" work. The `.bni` file-length cap is currently 1500/1800 (warn/error); consider lowering toward 1000/1200.
- **Blocker**: `pkg/binate/ir.bni` (~1183 lines) exceeds the proposed lower cap and would need refactoring (split into sub-interfaces) first. A live `TODO` in `scripts/hygiene/file-length.sh` tracks this.
- (Full resolved diagnosis of the ifaces/impls hygiene-scan extension archived in claude-todo-done.md.)

## Type-system & checker semantics

### `Self`-parameter method is uncallable through a generic constraint (Self binds to the type param, not its base) — 🟠 OPEN (2026-07-03)

**Severity: minor (obscure `Self` corner; the fix is a semantics decision, not a
clear defect).** A `Self`-parameter interface method — `eq(other Self)`,
`grab(rest *[]Self)`, or a variadic `merge(others ...Self)` — is satisfiable and
directly callable, but **cannot be called THROUGH a generic constraint** when the
type param is a pointer, because the two `Self` resolutions disagree:

- **Impl-satisfaction** (`methodSigSatisfies`, `check_impl.bn`): `Self` → the impl's
  **base named type** (`named = recv.ReceiverBaseNamed()`, e.g. `Bag`). Correct, and
  matches §11 — `010`'s `eq(other Self)` is satisfied by `eq(other Square)` (a value).
- **Constraint-call binding** (`tryTypeParamMethodCall`, `check_method.bn`):
  `substituteSelf(param, recvType)` uses `recvType` = the **type param** (`T` = `*Bag`).

So inside `func f[T Eq](a T, b Bag) { a.eq(b) }`, `eq` expects `*Bag` (Self→T) while
the impl takes `Bag` (Self→base) → "cannot assign Bag to T". **General** — not
composite- or variadic-specific (the plain `eq(other Self)` reproduces it).

- **Consequence:** a `Self`-parameter method can't be invoked via a constraint with
  a pointer type param — and a constraint is the ONLY path that reaches such methods
  (they're object-unsafe through an interface value). So the variadics Phase 6c
  `substituteSelf`-recursion in `tryTypeParamMethodCall` (correct code) has no
  end-to-end test.
- **Repro:** `interface Eq { eq(other Self) bool }` + `impl *Bag` /
  `func (b *Bag) eq(other Bag) bool` + `func areEq[T Eq](a T, b Bag) bool { return
  a.eq(b) }`.
- **NOT a bug in impl-satisfaction** — that works; `*[]Self` is satisfiable and
  `conformance/regressions/iface-self-in-composite` is a POSITIVE test. (The earlier
  "satisfaction fails" framing was a test error: the repro impl used `*[]*Bag` where
  `Self=Bag` wants `*[]Bag`.)
- **Fix is a semantics decision** — should the constraint call bind `Self` to
  `base(T)` (matching impl-satisfaction), or should impl-satisfaction use the
  receiver form? Deferred pending that decision; **do not fix without one**.
- **Discovered:** 2026-07-03, adding variadics Phase 6 coverage.

---

### `print(42)` and friends: how do primitives implement interfaces? — DESIGN OPEN
- **Problem**: with the current rules, `int` (and other predeclared
  primitives) can't implement interfaces. Methods can only be
  declared on TYP_NAMED types (the receiver lookup in
  `check_decl_func.bn:resolveMethodReceiver` rejects `func (x int)
  ...` because `int` is TYP_INT, not TYP_NAMED). So a user-written
  `printIt(s *Stringer) { ... println(s.String()) }` can't accept
  a literal `42` — the user has to wrap with `type MyInt int` +
  impl, then write `printIt(&MyInt(42))`. That's a lot of
  ceremony for a basic use case.
- **Generics don't help.** A `printIt[T Stringer](t T)` call site
  still requires `T` to satisfy `Stringer`, so `int` would need a
  Stringer impl somewhere — same blocker as the non-generic case.
  Generics solve "extensible dispatch", not "primitives need to
  carry methods."
- **Today's escape**: `println(42)` works only because it's a
  compiler builtin — `bootstrap.println` synthesizes per-type
  formatting at the call site. Not user-extensible. The hack is
  documented as temporary in `feedback_println_hack.md`.
- **Two real options** (discussed 2026-05-07):
  1. **Language-blessed implicit interfaces.** The interface plan
     already lists `any` as a built-in implicit interface and
     reserves the mechanism for "small, closed, language-defined
     set" of others. Add `Stringer` (and possibly `Eq`, `Hash`,
     etc.) to that set — every type, including primitives, gets
     a synthesized impl from the compiler. Then a user-written
     `printIt(s *Stringer)` accepts any value uniformly.
     Cost: every iv gets a real vtable, even for primitives, and
     the language has to define the canonical formatting story
     for each primitive.
  2. **Standard-library carve-out for methods on universe types.**
     Allow a designated package (`pkg/std` or similar) to declare
     `func (x int) String() ...` even though `int` is a universe
     type. The carve-out exists only for the language's own std
     library; user packages still can't extend `int`. Closer to
     Go's `fmt.Println` model. Heavier carve-out but lets the
     std lib look like normal Binate code.
- **Lean (preliminary):** option 1 — the implicit-interface
  mechanism is already the named escape hatch, the formatting
  story for primitives is small + closed, and the result is
  user-extensible (their own types implement Stringer normally).
  But this is a real design call; needs a plan doc before
  shipping.
- **Not blocking**: today's `println(42)` carries the load.
  Revisit when generics land or when a user-written `printIt`-
  style function becomes pressing.

### Purely-value const extension (future language direction) — DESIGN, not started
Future direction split out of the (now-resolved) non-int-const mis-emit bug:
allow `const` of certain non-scalar but purely-value types (no storage, no
managed fields). Currently `const` is scalar-only (non-scalar → `errNonScalarConst`,
"use `var readonly`"); no `isPurelyValueType` predicate exists yet. A genuine
language extension, not a bug fix.

## Language-feature proposals

### Switch `fallthrough` — proposal
- Not in the current grammar (`grammar.ebnf`). Binate switch cases are implicit-break (Go-style), but there's no opt-in for Go's `fallthrough` keyword.
- Would add one reserved keyword, one AST statement kind (`STMT_FALLTHROUGH`), and one IR lowering (branch to the next case's entry block, skipping its case-value check).
- Before implementing: decide whether we want it at all. Arguments for: matches reader expectations from Go, lets users avoid duplicated bodies across related cases. Arguments against: rarely needed in practice, adds a new keyword for a small ergonomic win, forces the type checker to recognize terminators beyond `return`/`panic` (termination analysis already inspects case bodies for bare `break`).
- Likely a decline unless a concrete use case comes up, but worth capturing as a live option.

### Termination analysis — labeled break
- Missing-return check (test 245) uses Go-style termination analysis simplified: RETURN terminates; `panic(...)` terminates; BLOCK terminates if last stmt does; IF terminates if both branches do; FOR with no condition and no `break` in body terminates; SWITCH with default and all cases terminating (no break) terminates.
- **Labeled break**: Binate currently has no labels. If/when we add them, termination analysis needs to track labels — a `break L` inside a nested for doesn't break the inner for (contrary to the current "any break disqualifies enclosing for/switch" rule). Revisit when labels are on the table.

### Import aliases and blank imports
- Do we support Go-like `import somethingelse "pkg/foo"` currently? We'll likely need this.
- Do we support `import _ "pkg/foo"`? Should we? (Side-effect-only imports.)
- Both interact with the package object naming question above.

### Whole-package re-export (`expose`) — 🟢 IMPLEMENTED + SPECIFIED + TESTED — one passive residual

The core `.bni` declaration `expose "pkg/std/foo"` re-exports another package's whole
exported surface (for refactors/renames — promote `pkg/stdx/foo` → `pkg/std/foo` behind a
forwarder `.bni` — and internal aggregation): identity-preserving (A.X *is* B.X), flat,
transitive, surface-only (Model 2, not a dot-import), vars included, collisions-are-errors.
**Landed** (`76d76d3f`): parser / loader / scope-injection / closure-registration /
resolved-home mangling (the crux — func/var/const mangling was spelling-driven, now follows
the resolved entity's home across the ~75 `resolveImportPkg`/`buildQualName` sites) /
collision check, plus reflect + the conformance bundle (`1028`/`1032`–`1053`, 17 tests).
**Spec'd**: §16.5.2 + `binate.ebnf` `ExposeDecl` + nine `pkg.expose.*` rules. No
backend/codegen work. Design/plan: [design-expose.md](design-expose.md),
[plan-expose-execution.md](plan-expose-execution.md).
**Only residual (passive):** gated from `cmd/bnc`'s own `.bni` use until a BUILDER
understanding `expose` is pinned — clears on the next BUILDER bump.

## Spec authoring & language-decision residuals

### §8.5 spec "precision residual" note appears stale — verify and drop
The §8.5 "Open (precision residual)" note in the conversions spec chapter says a constant
≥ 2^63 reached through a bitwise/shift op "is not yet rejected": `cast(int64, 0x4000000000000000 << 1)`. That exact
example — and `cast(int64, 1 << 63)` — now **reject** ("constant does not fit the cast
target type"). The bitwise-const fold may have been fixed; verify (other patterns?) and, if
so, drop the §8.5 residual note (like the Ch.13 generic-unparsed/d4-paren stale notes). No
born-stale xfail added (rejection is the correct behavior). Surfaced authoring
`conformance/spec/08-conversions`.

### §13.6 `expr.compare.aggregate` is STALE — struct/array `==`/`!=` IS implemented — update the spec
Reported by a worker 2026-07-11. The rule (`docs/spec/13-expressions.md:130-134`) still says
"**Implementation gap:** this lowering is not implemented, so `==`/`!=` on a struct or array is
currently rejected (‘not yet implemented’)." That is stale — struct/array element-wise equality is
**implemented & landed** (`f99f4a4e` "ir/types: implement struct/array equality (==/!=)
field/element-wise"; conformance `490_nested_anon_struct_equiv` / `491_anon_struct_managed_field_equiv`;
see the archived "`==`/`!=` on aggregates" done entry). **Fix:** reword §13.6 to state the working
element-wise-comparable rule (a struct/array is comparable iff every field/element is), drop the
"not implemented / rejected" gap text, and bump the implementation-conformance status (Annex C).
(The remaining generic-re-check corner cases are separately tracked and NOT a spec gap.)

### Relational-comparison chain (`a < b < c`) diagnostic reach — nicety
The `expr.compare.relational` rule: `a < b < c` is correctly rejected in every context, but the
dedicated "comparison operators do not chain" message fires only for the identifier-leading
for-clause Pratt path (`parse_for.bn:199`); `if`/`var`/literal-leading contexts reject via generic
parse errors. Conformant (rejection holds) — a diagnostic-consistency nicety only. Surfaced
authoring `conformance/spec/13-expressions`.

### Spec Ch.16 (Packages) — adversarial-review follow-ups (test-quality, non-blocking) — 2026-06-19
The Ch.16 review found 0 blockers, 7 should-fix (landed tests work; these
improve rigor). 015 mis-cite already FIXED (re-cited pkg.resolve→pkg.identity).
Remaining, for a focused follow-up (with the build-constraint rework below):
- **Harness limit (root cause of 2 findings):** the runner gives a test ONE
  search root, so `pkg.resolve.public` (013, public-vs-local under DIFFERENT
  roots) and `pkg.resolve`'s independent-.bni/impl-roots facet (012) can't be
  exercised — both tests only show "resolves under one root". Soften their
  comments to not overclaim; the multi-root facets need a harness extension (a
  second `--prepend` root) — note in Annex C as untested.
- **Vacuity to tighten:** 050 (`pkg.identity`) asserts values, not type-
  distinctness — the distinctness is actually pinned by 051's cross-pkg-assign
  reject; re-scope 050's comment. 091 (`pkg.extern` var) only reads once — make
  var-ness load-bearing (mutate via a setter, observe). 090 extern-func is the
  same shape as a normal exported func (inherent).
- **Missing coverage:** `pkg.bni.consistency` only tests return/var-type
  mismatch (033/034) — add param-type + param-count + result-count mismatch.
  `pkg.bni` (032) omits the opaque-type and interface/impl .bni decl kinds.
  `pkg.ccall` (092) has no C-ABI-passability reject test (§16.9). `pkg.clause`
  (010) and `pkg.import` (001) lack negative tests (package-must-be-a-string-
  literal; no block-scoped import).

### Spec Ch.16 build-constraint group — only the `pkg.build.errors` conformance test remains — 🟡 (done parts in done log, 2026-07-10)
The build-constraint rework is done (re-authored `075_build_gate_file` / `076_build_gate_import` on the
real file/import gating mechanism; the "unknown predicate/annotation" possible-gap was NOT a real
validation gap — the compiler rejects them under a resolved config, unit-tested — see the done log).
**Remaining:** the one uncovered rule `pkg.build.errors` needs a conformance `.error` test — a
`#[build(is(<unknown-predicate>, "x"))]` (or unknown tag) on a *required* element under a resolved
target, so validation fires and the build aborts. Ch.16 stays 21/22 until then (behavior is
unit-tested in `buildcfg_test.bn`).

### Observable optimizations and UB policy — broader question
- Surfaced while planning const: allowing the compiler to allocate
  a shared static global for all-const composite literals is an
  optimization observable via raw-pointer comparison (`&a[0] ==
  &b[0]` where `a`, `b` are both `"hello"`). The const plan accepts
  this as UB rather than either blocking the optimization or
  carving out precise "same-literal-text gives same address"
  semantics.
- Same class as the refcounting move optimizations that are already
  observable via `rt.Refcount(...)` without a nailed-down spec.
- **Broader question**: do we want a general policy of "these kinds
  of observations are UB, the compiler may optimize across them",
  written up somewhere authoritative? Candidates for the same UB
  bucket: literal address identity, refcount timing, struct padding
  bytes, uninitialized-memory reads of stack-allocated vars. The
  alternative (fully specified observable behavior) is probably
  incompatible with small-target codegen goals.
- Not urgent — we're already making these trade-offs silently. A
  short design note ratifying the policy would be useful when a
  future optimization / feature forces the question.

### Secondary specs — testing + stdlib (primary spec is written) — 🟡 OPEN
The **primary** language spec is **written & maintained in `docs/spec/`** (21 chapters +
Annexes A-D, canonical `binate.ebnf`, rule-ID apparatus; reconciled as features land) — moved to
the done log ("Primary language spec — WRITTEN"). Philosophy: `claude-notes.md` § "Language
specification — primary spec is minimal — DECIDED". Remaining, both **NOT started**:
- **Minor secondary spec — testing**: the `_test.bn` packaging convention + `pkg/builtins/testing`.
  May fold into the primary; TBD.
- **Major secondary spec(s) — stdlib**: I/O, containers, formatting, string utilities, etc. —
  probably split by area.

Artifact when writing begins: alongside `docs/spec/` or `explorations/spec-*.md`. (The `pkg/rt`
review below still gates finalizing §20.2's normative surface, currently Draft.)

### pkg/rt review — decide runtime vs. stdlib vs. internal
- Today `pkg/rt` is a grab-bag of runtime helpers, refcount
  primitives, allocator wrappers, bounds-check stubs, etc.
- For the primary spec to nail down "what the runtime contract
  is," `pkg/rt`'s surface needs a review: classify each member as
  **stay** (truly language-runtime, normative in the primary
  spec), **move** (standard-library-shaped — belongs in a stdlib
  package, out of `pkg/rt`), or **make-internal** (only used by
  the language implementation itself, no `.bni` export).
- Output: a classification of `pkg/rt` members + a follow-up
  cleanup plan (a `plan-*.md` doc under `explorations/`). The
  cleanup itself is separate work and can be sequenced
  independently — what's important first is the *classification*,
  which unblocks the primary spec writeup.

## Codegen & backend (non-func-value)

### Big-endian CODEGEN — deferred (no BE target exists yet) — 🟡 DEFERRED
The Ch.7.13 layout follow-ups (`type.layout.funcval-order-hardening` + the
`type.layout.byte-order` decision / `TargetInfo.BigEndian` field + little-endian-only
assert) are ✅ DONE & LANDED — see [claude-todo-done.md](claude-todo-done.md). What
remains: actual big-endian byte-EMISSION (object writers, `ir.DataGlobal` int terms,
`bit_cast` / the representation builtins) for a future big-endian / cross-endian
target. `SetTarget` currently `panic`s on a big-endian target, so there is no
silent-wrong-code risk meanwhile; do this when such a target is actually needed.

### DWARF debug info — finer-grained source positions (open-ended, low priority) — 🟡 OPEN

The DWARF foundation + full type coverage are done (archived in [claude-todo-done.md](claude-todo-done.md):
`-g`, DICompileUnit/DIFile/DISubprogram, per-function DISubroutineType, DILocalVariable for
locals + params, and DIBasicType/DICompositeType/DIDerivedType covering scalars, pointers,
structs, slices, managed-slices, interface-values, function-values, arrays, named typedefs).
The one remaining, open-ended piece:
- Thread source positions through more IR-gen sites (statements, assignments, calls) for
  finer-grained `DILocation` — today only `genExpr` threads `.Line`; most emission sites rely
  on coarse statement-line backfill. No columns.
- No `llvm.dbg.value` (only `dbg.declare` for allocas).

### Static-managed sentinel — deferred follow-ups (optimizations, not correctness) — 🟢 LOW
Follow-ups split out of the (now-done) static-managed sentinel landing:
- **String-literal null-backing unification**: can the string-literal
  `backing_refptr = null` immortality trick (`emit.bn`) be unified under the
  negative-refcount sentinel? Representation can plausibly unify; the nil-check
  itself can't be dropped (it guards genuinely-nil `@` values). Repr cleanup.
- **ClosureRec-as-sentinel**: the VM's shared per-callee non-capturing-`@func`
  `ClosureRec` (`vm_exec_funcref.bn`) is a static, never-freed managed object.
  The premature-free CRITICAL was already fixed symmetrically (conformance 528);
  making the shared `ClosureRec` an immortal sentinel would remove per-instance
  refcount churn on a shared singleton. Optimization, not a correctness gap.

### relro section infra (`__DATA_CONST` / `.data.rel.ro`) for relocatable read-only data — 🟡 OPEN (follow-up from DataGlobal Inc 4b)

Today every **relocatable** read-only blob — the `_Package` descriptor node, the
info-node tables, the backing arrays, all vtables, the string `.ms` managed-slice
header — stays in writable `data` rather than rodata, because Mach-O rejects
relocations out of `__TEXT,__const` (text-relocs) and the object writer has no
relro section.  These blobs are logically immutable after load; leaving them
writable is a hardening gap (a stray write corrupts a descriptor/vtable instead of
faulting), not a correctness bug — `DataGlobal.ReadOnly` already routes
non-relocatable read-only data (e.g. string bytes) to rodata correctly.

**Fix:** add a relro section — Mach-O `__DATA_CONST,__const` + ELF `.data.rel.ro`
(`SHF_ALLOC|SHF_WRITE`) — and route relocatable `ReadOnly` `DataGlobal`s there so
they become read-only-after-load (the dynamic loader applies relocations, then the
page is remapped read-only).  This is a new object-writer feature
(segment/section/load-command emission); verify on both formats + arm32.  Low
urgency (no current miscompile; the writable placement is safe, just unhardened).

## Performance (double-VM `*-int-int` runtime)

### pkg/codegen `TestEmitDebug*` dominates `boot-comp-int-int` runtime (perf)
- **Symptom**: pkg/codegen unit tests take ~1084s in CI under
  `boot-comp-int-int` (vs ~4s under `boot-comp-int`). The 26
  `TestEmitDebug*` tests account for ~78% of that runtime (~500s
  on local Apple Silicon, scaling up on CI x86). Top offenders:
  `TestEmitDebugStructWithArrayAndSliceFields` (~79s),
  `TestEmitDebugSliceFieldInStruct` (~41s),
  `TestEmitDebugSliceOfPointerChain` (~32s).
- **Isolated repro**: `TestEmitDebugStructWithArrayAndSliceFields`
  alone — 0.7s under `boot-comp-int`, ~120s under
  `boot-comp-int-int` (>100× slowdown for one test).
- **Mitigation in tree**: `scripts/unittest/pkg-codegen.skip.boot-comp-int-int`
  skips the `TestEmitDebug` substring under double interp. Coverage
  is preserved by every other mode that exercises codegen
  (`boot`, `boot-comp`, `boot-comp-int`, `boot-comp-comp*`).
- **Root cause to investigate**: each `TestEmitDebug*` runs
  `compileToLLVM(src)` with `SetDebugInfo(true)`. The DWARF emission
  path (DICompositeType chains, DIDerivedType members, member
  scope/baseType references) is heavy on string-building and
  small allocations. Under double interp every byte append /
  small allocation pays 2× bytecode-dispatch overhead, and there
  are many of them per test.
- **Possible angles** (investigated; first attempt was a net loss):
  1. Buffered string construction in `pkg/codegen/emit_debug*.bn`
     — coalesce per-node fragments to reduce CharBuf grows.  On
     inspection the literal-string `WriteStr` calls are already
     coalesced; the only repeating fusable pattern is `WriteByte('!')
     + WriteInt(id)` (~18 sites).  Mechanically fusable but ~18
     dispatches saved per node-emit × ~10 nodes/test ≈ milliseconds.
     Won't move 100s+ runtimes meaningfully.
  2. Cache stable strings (e.g. DI tag names, common type keys).
     **Tried 2026-05-13**: pointer-keyed cache in `dbgTypeID` that
     short-circuits `dbgTypeKey` for repeat lookups.  Single-test
     baseline 160s → 106s (-34%), but aggregate of all 26
     `TestEmitDebug*` went 441s → 513s (+16%) under boot-comp-int-int
     locally — the added pointer-scan per call pays off only when
     the registry is large (few slow tests) but slows the small-
     registry common case.  Reverted; needs a cache that's O(1)
     per call (e.g. a side-table on `@types.Type` itself, with the
     attendant `pkg/types` layout-contract implications).
  3. Reduce redundant work in the type registry — same composite
     type is rebuilt every call to `compileToLLVM`.  Cross-test
     state would also need per-module id offsets to keep nodes
     self-consistent; non-trivial.
- **Real next step**: actually profile before guessing again.  The
  intuition that "many small allocations × double-interp overhead"
  is the cost was correct in direction but wrong in distribution —
  most of the cost isn't where it looks like it should be.
- **Not blocking anything**; mitigation in tree (`1bffc43`).

### pkg/asm/aarch64 slow under `builder-comp-int-int` (perf)
- **Symptom**: under `builder-comp-int-int`, the
  `pkg/asm/aarch64` test package alone is slow enough to time
  out its CI shard at the 30-min cap. Other packages in the
  same mode finish comfortably.
- **Mitigation in tree**: skipped via the whole-package skip
  mechanism `scripts/unittest/pkg-binate-asm-aarch64.skip-pkg.builder-comp-int-int`
  (2026-06-10 — migrated from the old `.xfail`; slowness is a skip,
  not an expected failure). Coverage is preserved by `builder-comp`,
  `builder-comp-int`, `builder-comp-comp*` and the native_aa64 / arm32
  modes — this is purely a double-interp pacing issue. See the
  "int-int slow-package skips" entry below in this group.
- **Hypothesis**: same shape as the codegen `TestEmitDebug*`
  entry above — many small CharBuf / refcount / bounds-check
  operations per emitted instruction, each paying 2× bytecode-
  dispatch overhead under VM-on-VM. The aarch64 assembler is
  string-heavy (encoding tables, mnemonic dispatch). Hasn't
  been profiled.
- **Next step**: profile one `pkg/asm/aarch64` test under
  `builder-comp-int-int` to confirm the hypothesis and identify
  the actual hot path before guessing at fixes. See the codegen
  entry above for the lesson on guessing-without-profiling.
- **Not blocking anything**; mitigation in tree.

### int-int slow-package skips — re-add after optimizing (or decide double-VM coverage isn't worth it) — FILED 2026-06-10
- **Context**: `builder-comp-int-int` (double-VM, VM-interpreting-VM) was "globally broken — every cell SIGSEGV'd" until `c997cf2e` (2026-06-09) made cells actually run. Now-healthy, the lane runs ~120+ min of work and was timing out its CI shards. Bumping unit sharding 4→8 (binate `e40fe3a0`) helped the light half but **4 of 8 shards still timed out at the 30-min cap, each completing ≤1 package** — i.e. a handful of packages each take **>~24 min (or hang) under double-VM**, which sharding can't fix (a single package can't be split across shards).
- **New mechanism (not xfail)**: added a whole-package skip — `scripts/unittest/<pkg-key>.skip-pkg.<mode>` (run.sh). Distinct from `.xfail` (asserts the package FAILS; XPASS-errors if it ever passes) and from `.skip` (drops individual tests but still runs the package). `.skip-pkg` omits the whole package from a mode because it's too slow there; it is NOT a failure (the tests pass — they're just not run in this lane). Counted as `pkg-skipped` in the summary.
- **Skipped under `builder-comp-int-int`**: round 1 (2026-06-10) — `pkg/binate/codegen` (its `TestEmitDebug` per-test `.skip` was insufficient), `pkg/binate/ir`, `pkg/binate/types`, `pkg/std/math/big`, `pkg/binate/asm/aarch64` (migrated from `.xfail`); these took 6 of 8 shards green. Round 2 (2026-06-10) — added `pkg/binate/vm` itself (CI showed it was the last timed-out shard's >24-min offender). The set was found empirically (heuristic + iterating on which shard still timed out), since the timed-out shards never log the offender's time.
- **Re-add work (the "separately" part)**: for each skipped package, either (a) profile + optimize its double-VM runtime so it fits a shard, or (b) make the explicit call that the double-VM lane adds no coverage over single-VM (`-int`) for that package (strong for the compiler-side ones — codegen/ir/types/asm test the COMPILER; `-int` already runs their tests through the VM; double-VM is the same logic + an extra dispatch layer). `pkg/binate/vm` is the one whose lost double-VM coverage is most arguable — its logic is still covered by `builder-comp-int` / `-comp-int` (single VM), and the lane's unique value is exercised by every OTHER package; re-adding it likely wants per-test `.skip` of its slowest tests rather than the whole package. When re-adding `codegen`, its `TestEmitDebug` per-test `.skip` still applies.
- **Separately unmasked**: `pkg/std/os` (landed `3ca36c82`) fails `vm/lower: unhandled IR opcode c_call` on ALL three VM-leg unit modes — libc-backed (native-only), same category as the `rt`/`bootstrap` xfails. NOT a slow-skip case (it genuinely FAILS in the VM), so it's `.xfail`'d (not `.skip-pkg`'d) for `builder-comp-int` / `-comp-int` / `-int-int`, matching that convention. My skips merely unmasked it (the shard used to time out before reaching it); it was already reding `builder-comp-int` independently.
- **Not a release blocker** (int-int non-blocking per `release-process.md`; was red at `bnc-0.0.7` too). Tracked here so the skips don't become permanent silent coverage loss.
- **STATUS 2026-06-10 — GREEN** (unit run on `3342460e`): all 8 `builder-comp-int-int` shards pass (2.5–26.7 min) and `builder-comp-int` / `-comp-int` pass. **Margin note**: shard 4/8 ran 26.7 min — ~89% of the 30-min cap; the 8-shard + skip set is sufficient but thin, so if the int-int suite grows it may need a 9th–10th shard or one more skip before it times out again. (The remaining unit reds — `arm32_{linux,baremetal}`, `native_x64` — are separate modes, not this. NOTE: `native_x64` was NOT "WIP" — it was broken by an ELF PC32 reloc bug, fixed 2026-06-14 `dd74c91e`; that native_x64 ELF PC32 reloc bug is fixed and archived in claude-todo-done.md.)

## Testing: harness, runners & conformance coverage

### Conformance harness: `pkg0.testing` `--test`-only rules are not conformance-testable

1. **GAP (harness limitation, not a defect) — `pkg0.testing.testfunc` + `pkg0.testing.run` are not
   conformance-testable.** Both require the `--test` discovery/execution runner (`cmd/bnc --test` /
   `cmd/bni --test`); `conformance/run.sh` only runs ordinary programs (no `--test` plumbing). They
   are exercised by the unit-test suite, not conformance. Closing them would need a test-runner mode
   added to the harness. Left as documented coverage gaps (Ch.20 is 18/20). Candidate for an
   `untestable`/`framework` reclassification in `extract-rule-ids.py` (a denominator decision).

### Better test-mode/target annotation than `.xfail` (unit + conformance)
- We lean on `.xfail.<mode>` files to mark tests that can't run in a
  given configuration (e.g. `pkg-builtins-rt.xfail.builder-comp-int*`
  because rt is native-only in the VM; the `__c_call` conformance tests
  498/500/527/530 xfailed in every VM-leg mode). But "expected to FAIL"
  is the wrong semantics for "not APPLICABLE here" — these tests are
  *bnc-only* / *vm-only* / *target-specific* by nature, not regressions.
- **Want**: a first-class annotation (in the test source or a manifest)
  declaring a test's applicable modes/targets — `bnc-only`, `vm-only`,
  per-backend, per-target — so the runner *skips* inapplicable configs
  cleanly and reserves `xfail` for genuine known-failures. Would also
  let `__c_call` tests declare "compiled-only" honestly instead of a
  fan of per-mode xfail files.
- Surfaced 2026-06-03 by the drop-libc / native-only-rt work.

### Test runner improvements
- ~~**Better docs/help**~~: DONE. Both runners show description, examples, flag docs, test format/convention docs, xfail mechanism. READMEs added for conformance/ and scripts/unittest/.
- ~~**Better output**~~: DONE. `-v` (verbose: all test names), `-q` (quiet: failures+summary only), default (dots for passes, detail for failures).
- ~~**Mode sets in files**~~: DONE. `scripts/modesets/` directory with one file per set (basic, all, full). Adding a new mode set is just adding a file. Both runners read from the shared directory. Help output dynamically lists available sets.
- ~~**Better mode specification**~~: DONE. Comma-separated modes (`boot,boot-comp`) expand into sequential runs. Works alongside mode set files.
- ~~**Better filtering (unit tests)**~~: DONE. Fixed unit test runner to use substring match (was exact match). `token` now matches `pkg/token`, consistent with conformance runner.
- **Better filtering (individual test functions)**: ability to specify individual test functions, not just packages (e.g., `run.sh boot-comp pkg/ir TestFoo`).
- **Timeout/hang handling**: better and/or automatic detection and handling of tests that hang.
- **Parallelization**: consider running test packages in parallel within a mode.

### Build out e2e testing
- We have unit tests (per package) and conformance tests (language
  semantics). What we don't have is a place for **end-to-end tool
  integration tests** — checks that the CLI/loader/runtime wiring
  works the same way across all four tools that load Binate
  packages: `bootstrap`, `bnc`, `bni`, `bnlint`.
- **What's landed (2026-04-30):**
  - Two scripts: `e2e/split-paths.sh` (the original — `-I`/`-L`
    cross-tool contract; covers Stage 1–6 of the package-search-paths
    plan) and `e2e/repl.sh` (9 cases for `bni --repl`: basic call,
    multi-stmt, error recovery, multi-line for-block, braces in
    string literal, plus four Tier 2 cases — func persists, cross-
    decl call, type rejected with diagnostic, bad body recovery).
  - CI hookup at `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` — matrix-
    discovery via `ls e2e/*.sh`, one runner per script, `fail-fast:
    false`.  Standard checkout layout (binate + bootstrap as
    siblings) matches what the scripts assume.  New e2e scripts are
    picked up automatically.
- **Unique challenges this dir still has to solve over time:**
  - **4 tools, not 1.** A single feature (like `-I`/`-L`) needs to
    be exercised on each tool independently, since each parses CLI
    flags separately and threads them into the loader differently.
  - **Multiple build/run modes for the binate-written tools.** bnc,
    bni, and bnlint can each be exercised through several pipelines:
    bnc via boot-comp / boot-comp-comp / boot-comp-comp-comp /
    boot-comp_native_aa64; bni via boot-comp-int / boot-comp-comp-int;
    bnlint via the same chains as bnc. Note that bni cannot be
    interpreted directly by the bootstrap (cmd/bni imports pkg/vm,
    whose float literals the bootstrap lexer doesn't recognize) —
    bni really has to be built via boot-comp first.
    Full e2e coverage of "feature X works" multiplies tools × build
    modes — easily 10+ runs per feature. We don't necessarily want
    that today; figuring out which slice is worth the cost is part
    of building this out.  Today both shipping scripts pick a
    single mode each (split-paths covers all four tools at their
    "default" build path; repl uses boot-comp bni).
  - **Fixture management.** Conformance tests share a single root;
    e2e tests like split-paths need disjoint fixtures, ad-hoc temp
    dirs, optional checked-in subtrees. No standard pattern yet —
    both current scripts use `mktemp -d` + `trap rm -rf` and inline
    `cat <<EOF` heredocs for fixture files.
- **Why these scripts are useful motivating examples:**
  - **split-paths**: the `-I`/`-L` feature is something `bootstrap`,
    `bnc`, `bni`, and `bnlint` should all support **identically** —
    a deliberate cross-tool contract.  e2e is the only layer where
    that contract can be observed directly.
  - **repl**: the `bni --repl` PoC is a multi-stage user-facing
    flow (load module → drive prompt via stdin → check banner +

    exercise the full input-to-output transcript; e2e is the right
    layer for "the REPL works end-to-end".

### Matrix tests for expanded generics + type assertions/RTTI — 🟡 PART A LANDED, PART B OPEN (brief plan 2026-07-10)

Two new `conformance/matrix/` families, motivated by the recent bug cluster (all in these
spaces, several false-green because tested in-package or in one combination): `8d9e7577`
xpkg-generic-managed-dtor, `c14dd95e`/`aba92526` named-wrapper dtor/copy, `42b3bc83`
func-value/array type-arg conflation, `fedbd0c5` method-value-on-generic. Brief plan:
[plan-matrix-tests-generics-rtti.md](plan-matrix-tests-generics-rtti.md).

**(A) Generics matrix — ✅ core BUILT & LANDED** as `conformance/matrix/generic-managed/`
(sub-axes `inpkg` / `xpkg` / `method-value` / `distinct`, 18 cells + generator; commits
`591f6945` bug-dense core, `ca3dd5b5` method-value + type-distinctness, `bea54fc2`
managed-struct + func-value, `a5869af1` iface balance element). Invariants in place:
links+runs, refcount balance (relative form), type-distinctness (compile-error pairs —
array-len `[3]`/`[5]`, func-sig `(int)uint`/`(bool)uint`), empty/never-populated destroy.
The `iface` balance element's `xpkg` cell uses `gh.At[@Numbered](h,0).num()` (iface-method
CALL on a generic-call result), so it regression-guards conformance/1027 (`dfbdf1dd`).
**Remaining (the plan's deferred "second wave"):** method-**expression** cells,
parameterized-receiver-impl dispatch (`impl *Cursor[T] : Iterator[T]`), and
generic-constraint dispatch; plus array-of-managed / nested-generic element kinds and
`copy` / `destroy-populated` ops.

**(B) Type-assertion/RTTI matrix — ❌ NOT built.** Axes = source `*I`/`@I`/`*any` × recovery
kind × target (concrete/interface incl. transitive) × form × outcome × mode; invariants =
recovery-kind legality, match correctness, `@T`-recovery refcount balance, cross-mode result
agreement. **Status correction (the plan doc's Section B is stale):** type *assertions* ARE
implemented + conformance-tested — `parse_assert.bn`/`check_assert.bn`/`gen_assert*.bn` +
conformance `998`–`1015` (concrete, iface, transitive-ancestor, comma-ok) — so the **assertion
cells are buildable NOW in compiled mode** (incl. the recovery-legality compile-error cells).
Only the **type-switch** cells are gated (parser exists but **no IR-gen lowering** — execution-
plan Phase 6), and the **VM / cross-mode-agreement** axis is gated on the VM RTTI path
(Slice 5). So build B as: assertion cells now → type-switch cells at Phase 6 → VM axis at
Slice 5.

Adopt the matrices only (wiring CI/hygiene is a separate decision).

### (b2 residual) code-red Class 7 — captured-`@func` over-release, native↔VM balance test — 🟡 (Class 6 done, in done log)
The one remaining lifecycle-matrix item: a single-program refcount-balance test of a native call to a
captured `@func` through the VM trampoline. UNBLOCKED — the "needs a cross-mode harness" blocker is
cleared (`e2e/xmiface.sh` / `e2e/xmhfa.sh` exist); add a captured-`@func` refcount-balance case there.
(`conformance/matrix/dispatch-refcount/funcval` is single-mode multi-return balance, not this.)

### (b4) Differential harness v3 — port `gen-diff-scalar.py` to Binate (dogfood) + flavor B — NOT STARTED
- **Context**: the property-based differential value-correctness harness
  (`conformance/matrix/scalar-diff`, oracle = spec) is realized through v2 —
  shifts, conversions, arithmetic, comparisons, bitwise; 123 cells / 5415
  tuples; generator `conformance/gen-diff-scalar.py` (Python). See
  `plan-differential-testing.md` (phasing item 3) for the full design.
- **v3 scope** (the remaining phase):
  1. **Port the generator to Binate** — rewrite `gen-diff-scalar.py` as a `.bn`
     program so the harness dogfoods the language on a real codegen-shaped task
     (LCG, two's-complement oracle, bit-pattern formatting). Keep the emitted
     cells byte-identical so the existing `.expected`/`.xfail` set and
     `--check` idempotence carry over unchanged.
  2. **Flavor B (optional, for the highest-volume ops)** — one self-checking
     `.bn` per op that loops an embedded `(inputs, expected)` table and prints
     `mismatch i: got… want…`, denser than the current static-cell flavor A and
     debuggable on failure (flavor A shows *which* tuple, not the wrong value).
     Decide per op once flavor A shows which need the volume.
  3. **Sample-size knob** — a fixed, seeded count parameter so coverage can be
     dialed up without touching the generator logic.
- **Why**: dogfooding is the highest-leverage *process* check (the OOM, the
  `@func`-dtor crash, the shift bug all first surfaced by compiling real Binate
  programs); porting the generator turns the harness itself into one more such
  program. Not urgent — v1/v2 already give the value coverage; v3 is the
  dogfood + debuggability upgrade.

## Standard library & libraries

### Standard library design
- Candidates: growable collections (Vec[T], Map[K,V] post-generics), I/O abstractions, string utilities, formatting
- CharBuf is implemented (pkg/buf); broader stdlib design should inform future collection APIs

### `os.Args()` — one open follow-up (argv[0] on the compiled path)
`os.Args()` is landed and correct in every mode, including under the interpreter
(SetArgs + bni wiring — see the done log).  One follow-up remains:

- **argv[0] is an empty placeholder on the COMPILED path.** Element 0 (the
  program name) is left empty because nothing exposes argv[0] yet —
  `bootstrap.Args()` deliberately returns the arguments only, and its one
  remaining consumer, cmd/bnc (BUILDER-compiled, so it stays on
  `bootstrap.Args()`), relies on that.  The other out-of-tree tools
  (bnlint/bnas/bnfmt) now read `os.Args()` instead — see the done log.  Populate
  element 0 once a bootstrap primitive surfaces the program name (e.g. a new
  `bootstrap.ProgName()`/`Arg0()`,
  or the C runtime storing `bn_argv[0]`).  A pure-additive change; the slot is
  already reserved.  This also converges the one remaining compiled/interpreted
  divergence — the interpreter already fills index 0 with the real program path
  via `os.SetArgs`.

### Expand `pkg/slices` beyond `Append` — opportunistic
- `pkg/slices.Append[T]` is the only generic helper today.  Natural
  additions when call sites demand them (don't add speculatively):
  - `Concat[T](a, b) @[]T` — for the managed-slice + managed-slice
    shape.  `bootstrap.Concat` covers the char-slice case but is
    raw-slice-typed.
  - `Filter[T, P]` / `Map[T, U]` — block on closures or func-value
    params; only worth it once those constraints land properly.
  - `RemoveLast[T](s) @[]T` — `popLoading`-style pattern (rebuild
    minus last occurrence) repeats per element type.
  - Don't pre-add a kitchen-sink set — let the first 2-3 call
    sites pull each helper in.
- **Survey 2026-05-28** of the BUILDER-compilable tree: none of the
  above clears the "2-3+ same-shape sites" bar at the moment.
  Concrete numbers found:
    * `Concat[T]` over two managed slices: 0 sites; the only
      `Concat` callers all funnel through char-specialised
      `bootstrap.Concat`.
    * `Contains[T]`: 4 candidate sites (`containsTypePtr` /
      `containsName` / `containsPkgName` / `containsStr`) but each
      uses a different equality (Identical / charEq / streq), so
      collapsing them needs func-value comparators or method-based
      equality — gap.
    * `Reverse[T]`: 1 site (loader `popLoading`).
    * `RemoveLast` / `RemoveByValue[T]`: 1 site (also loader
      `popLoading`, but it's "rebuild minus *streq match*", which
      is `RemoveWhere` shape — not a pure index/value remove).
    * `Copy[T]` one-liner: 2 sites; most slice-copies in the tree
      are inlined in larger functions.
  So no new helper to add right now without going speculative.
- **The real next pkg/slices step** the survey surfaced: 168
  `slices.Append[T]` calls live inside `for` loops, i.e. O(n²)
  builds.  Folding those into a growable container with amortised
  O(1) append (a `Vector[T]` / `Builder[T]` shape with capacity
  tracking) is a substantive design, not a quick add — file it for
  later when the surface is being intentionally pulled into a
  proper stdlib effort.

### `os` errors carry only the op, not the failing path (P3)
`pkg/std/os` `failErrno(op)` renders e.g. `"open: not found"`, but
plan-std-error-hierarchy.md §7 specifies context `(path, op)` —
`"open /etc/foo: not found"`. The path is available in `OpenFile`'s `name`
param (Create/Open delegate to it); `read`/`write`/`seek` operate on an fd and
have no path, so op-only is correct there. Add the failing path to the open
family's error context (e.g. a path-aware wrapper, or `failErrno(op, path)`).
Deferred 2026-06-11 (user: op-only acceptable for now) — low impact (message
richness, not classification). Tests: extend the `TestOpen*Classified` cases
to assert the path appears in the rendered message.

## Package management & search paths

### Package manager — sketch a design
- We don't have one yet. The current model is "everything lives under a
  root directory; `-I` and `-L` point the loader at extra search paths."
  Fine for the toolchain and a handful of conformance fixtures; doesn't
  scale to "I want to depend on `someone/foo` at version vX."
- Questions a sketch should answer:
  - Naming: are packages identified by URL (`github.com/...` Go-style),
    by a registry name, by a flat namespace? Interacts heavily with the
    package path conventions, decided in [`pkg-layout-spec.md`](pkg-layout-spec.md).
  - Manifest file format and location (`binate.toml` / `bn.mod` / TBD).
    What does a minimal valid manifest look like?
  - Dependency resolution: version constraints, lockfile, MVS vs SAT,
    handling of mutually-incompatible transitive deps.
  - Vendor / cache layout: per-project, per-user, or system-wide.
    Reproducibility story.
  - Binary artifacts vs. source: tied to the existing IMPL_PATH split
    (compiled `.o` / `.a` distribution vs. source) — see
    "Package path: binary artifacts on IMPL_PATH (Stage 8 / Phase 2)"
    below.
  - Interop with `.bni` distribution: the loader already treats `.bni`
    and impl as independent search paths; the package manager must
    respect that.
  - Bootstrap path: how does the bootstrap interpreter find packages?
    Probably "vendored copy in tree, no resolver." Confirm that's the
    right answer.
  - Out-of-tree builds: where do build artifacts go? How does the
    package manager interact with `--build-dir`?
- Output: a plan doc in `explorations/` (e.g. `plan-package-manager.md`),
  not implementation. The path conventions are already ratified in
  [`pkg-layout-spec.md`](pkg-layout-spec.md); this sketch builds on them
  (esp. its "Package manager interaction" section).

### Package path: env-var support (Stage 7)
- Add `BINATE_PACKAGE_INTERFACE_PATH` / `BINATE_PACKAGE_IMPL_PATH`
  (long names match `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`PYTHONPATH` style; aliases TBD)
  as the fallback when CLI flags are absent.
- Gated on adding `bootstrap.Getenv` (a few lines of C + Go-interp
  glue). Deferred because direct shell invocations of bnc/bni today
  can construct CLI arguments — the env-var fallback is convenience
  for users invoking the tools by hand.
- See [`plan-package-search-paths.md`](plan-package-search-paths.md)
  § "Env vars".

### Package path: binary artifacts on IMPL_PATH (Stage 8 / Phase 2)
- Once we have a stable per-package ABI/linker contract: accept
  `.o`/`.a`/`.so` files on `IMPL_PATH` as alternatives to `.bn`
  source. `hasImplFiles(dir)` becomes "has at least one of {.bn, .o,
  .a, .so}". Precedence rule (likely .o/.a/.so wins over .bn, with
  `--prefer-source` to override) is open.
- bnc would also gather binary artifacts from `IMPL_PATH` and feed
  them to the linker automatically (today users supply via
  `--cflag`).
- See [`plan-package-search-paths.md`](plan-package-search-paths.md)
  § "Future: binary impl artifacts".

## REPL

### REPL: remove process-global session state (multi-session blocker)
- **Now owned by [`plan-embeddable-vm.md`](plan-embeddable-vm.md)** (scoped
  2026-06-16): the `ir` half below is increments 4–5 of that plan, which
  covers the full compiler/VM global inventory, not just the REPL's two.
  This entry's `ir/gen.bn` line numbers are stale as of 2026-06-02; see the
  plan for verified ones.
- **What**: the REPL engine keeps per-session state in PROCESS-GLOBAL
  package vars instead of threading it through the session. v1 of the
  embeddable refactor (above) lifts the cmd/bni-local ones into
  `@ReplSession` but deliberately keeps **single live session per
  process**, leaving two `pkg/binate/ir` globals in place.
- **The globals**:
  - cmd/bni-local (lifted into `@ReplSession` by Stage 1 of the
    refactor): `replLoader`/`replRoot`/`replBniPaths`/`replProcessedPkgs`
    (`cmd/bni/repl_import.bn:24-41`) and `replInitCounter`
    (`cmd/bni/repl_decl.bn:411`).
  - `pkg/binate/ir` process-globals (NOT lifted in v1, the real
    multi-session blocker): `currentChecker` (`pkg/binate/ir/gen.bn:148`,
    set via `ir.SetChecker`) and the import alias map
    `importAliasNames`/`importAliasPaths` (`gen.bn:107/110`), with
    `Save`/`RestoreAliasMapState` bracketing in `evalReplImport`
    (`repl_import.bn:101/146`).
- **Why it matters**: single re-entrant session is unaffected (the ir
  globals are set once and save/restored inside import turns as today).
  But >1 concurrent embedded session in one process needs those globals
  session-scoped (or save/restored at every `Step` boundary) — a
  separate, larger change that must land BEFORE `pkg/binate/repl` can
  honestly claim multi-session support.
- **Guidance (applies now)**: **do not add any new REPL globals.** New
  per-session state goes through `@ReplSession`. Adding a global "to keep
  a signature stable" (the exact shortcut that created the current ones,
  per `repl_import.bn:18-20`) is what this entry exists to stop.
- **When**: only if multi-session embedding becomes a goal. Not needed
  for wasm B1 (one worker = one session).

### REPL — Tier-4 follow-ups + pretty-printer (all five tiers landed) — 🟡 OPEN (low priority)
Residual (all five REPL tiers landed):
- **Tier 4**: refcount-aware shadow warning (today fires unconditionally); forced-shadow escape hatch (syntax TBD per `claude-notes.md`).
- **Pretty-printer** (`pkg/replprint`) — deferred until interfaces land (`bootstrap.println` is a temporary hack; don't entrench it).
(Background/history archived in claude-todo-done.md.)

## ARM32 bare-metal target

### native arm32 backend — IN PROGRESS (live tracker: [plan-native-arm32.md](plan-native-arm32.md))

The `pkg/binate/native/arm32` backend (P0–P4-a done; P4-b/c/d + P5–P7 remaining)
is tracked in detail in `plan-native-arm32.md`; that doc is authoritative for
phase status, landed commits, and deferred shapes. Deferrals below are all
**fail-loud** (a shape the backend doesn't implement emits a clean COMPILE_ERROR,
never silent wrong-code) — EXCEPT the MAJOR bug just below, which violates that.

**FOLLOW-UP (aarch64-native, pre-existing, found 2026-07-05): cross-package
big-multi-return FUNC-VALUE call CRASHES on aarch64 native (empty output).**
Distinct from the arm32/x64 under-reservation bug below (aa64 has no
SretInGpArgReg, rides X8, so the sizer/emitter agree — not an under-reservation).
Exposed by a cross-module test (a dep `func F5(a,b,c int) (int,int,int,int,int)`
exported as `*func(int,int,int) (int,int,int,int,int)` via `Get5()`, called from
native main and printed) which PASSES on host + native arm32 + native x64 but
produces EMPTY output on `builder-comp_native_aa64-comp_native_aa64`.  889
(cross-pkg func value, NON-big-multi-return) passes on aa64, so it is the
big-multi-return shape specifically.  Likely the func-value shim ABI wants the
retbuf as a PREFIX ARG (the x64/arm32 convention) but aa64's emitCallFuncValue
uses X8 — a native↔LLVM boundary mismatch; needs investigation.  **aa64 native is
in `scripts/modesets/all` (a BLOCKING mode) and is currently 100% green (0
xfails)** — so this is a latent MAJOR bug on a blocking mode (untested until now).
The repro test was NOT committed (would redden aa64); recreate it (the F5/Get5
program above, expected `10 20 30 30 50` for args 10,20,30) when fixing aa64, and
add it to the P4-c/aa64 acceptance once green.  User decision (2026-07-05): land
the arm32/x64 fix now, do aa64 as a follow-up.

**MAJOR — FIXED (arm32 + x64) in P4-b2 (`bce99096`), found 2026-07-04 by the
P4-b2 review: big-multi-return FUNC-VALUE call under-reserves outgoing-args →
cross-module silent miscompile.** For an `OP_CALL_FUNC_VALUE`/`OP_CALL_HANDLE`
whose result is a big multi-return tuple (gpWords > NumGpRetRegs, so sret), the
native EMITTER uses `prefixSlots = 2` (retbuf in R0 + data in R1, via the
SretInGpArgReg convention) — see arm32_call_indirect.bn `emitCallFuncValue` and
x64_call_indirect.bn:226-230 (`useRetbuf = aggregateRet || bigMultiRet`). But the
shared SIZER `callDispatchArgTypesAnyOp` (common_call.bn:132-137, feeding
PlanFrame's outgoing-args reservation) gates its prefix bump on `aggregateRet`
which is `!IsMultiReturnCall` — so a big multi-return keeps `prefixSlots = 1` and
has NO bigMultiRet handling (unlike the direct-`OP_CALL` branch,
callDispatchArgTypes:91-93, which DOES prepend a slot for CallReturnsBigMultiReturn).
So emitter(2) vs sizer(1): with 3+ single-word user args the emitter spills the
3rd user word to SP+0, which PlanFrame never reserved → it overlaps the first
spill/alloc slot (a 523-class frame-corruption miscompile). SAME-module is
fail-loud (the arm32 sret shim rejects >2 args), but CROSS-module — an LLVM-dep
func value called from native main with 3+ args — emits the overlap with NO local
fail-loud → **silent miscompile at the native↔LLVM boundary**. **x64 has the
IDENTICAL pre-existing bug** (also SretInGpArgReg=true); aarch64 is safe (X8, no
SretInGpArgReg, prefixSlots stays 1). LATENT: no conformance test exercises a
big-multi-return func-value call with ≥3 user args. **Fix** (recommended, fixes
both, inert on aa64): in callDispatchArgTypesAnyOp's OP_CALL_FUNC_VALUE branch add
`if cc.SretInGpArgReg && ins.ID >= 0 && cc.CallReturnsBigMultiReturn(ins) {
prefixSlots = 2 }` — a shared change (touches x64 codegen for this shape, so
verify x64 units/conformance) + a conformance test.  DONE: the shared
`prefixSlots=2` bump landed in P4-b2 (`bce99096`), gated on `cc.SretInGpArgReg`
(fixes arm32 + x64, inert/byte-identical on aarch64); x64 native units +
func-value/multi-return conformance verified green; a `common_call` unit test
pins prefixSlots=2 (SysV/AAPCS32) vs 1 (AAPCS64).  The end-to-end cross-module
repro is the F5/Get5 test noted in the aa64 follow-up above (not committed because
it also trips the separate aa64 crash).

**MAJOR — FIXED (landed `bc42705e`, 2026-07-04, by-address): the func-value
consumer miscompiled aggregate ARGS through CROSS-PACKAGE func values.**
`emitCallFuncValue` (arm32_call_indirect.bn)
marshals user args via `emitCallArg` — the DIRECT-call ABI, which spreads an
aggregate as its inline words. But the func-value shim ABI passes an aggregate
arg BY-ADDRESS (one pointer word the shim re-expands). For a SAME-package func
value the arm32 shim is emitted and `shimUserArgWords` fail-louds aggregate/float/
pair args; but a CROSS-package func value's shim is LLVM-emitted, so the arm32
shim's fail-loud never runs and the consumer silently emits the mismatched
spread-words marshaling → the shim dereferences the first struct word as a pointer
→ a wild deref / runtime HANG (Data Abort loop) under QEMU. **Present since P4-a
(`a888e9cd`)**; the func-value CONSUMER was introduced there. Discovered via
`889_funcval_small_aggregate` (a cross-pkg func value taking an 8-byte struct by
value), which HANGS ([11s] QEMU timeout). **It was MISSED at P4-a land because the
hang-detection grep (`\[10s\]`) did not match the actual per-test timeout marker
on non-verbose output — a process miss: hang audits MUST grep the QEMU
"terminating on signal" message, not a `[Ns]` bracket.** Fix (confirmed: 889 →
COMPILE_ERROR): user chose to fully implement the by-address arg convention
(mirror x64/aa64 `AggCoercedInReg` → substitute to `*uint8` + pass a pointer), so
CROSS-package aggregate-arg func values now WORK (889 passes). SAME-package
aggregate-arg func values still fail-loud at SHIM emission (the arm32 shim can't
re-marshal an aggregate arg yet — `shimUserArgWords` rejects it; that shim
aggregate re-marshaling is the remaining piece, see below). 64-bit-pair ARGS ride
emitCallArg's pair placement (matches the shim ABI), so they are NOT fail-loud'd
in the consumer. Fixed as part of P4-b1 (`bc42705e`).

**725/727 cross-package reflect — ✅ RESOLVED (`4fe304dd`, 2026-07-12; see done log).**
NOT a miscompile: the 2026-07-04 symptom (per-function info not printed) was fixed by
intervening reflect/descriptor work, and the residual was STALE arm32 expected files
(pre-`0479813a` int64 `RetbufSize` 8; a single int64/float64 return is a register-pair,
RetbufSize 0, on ILP32 too). 725/727 now pass on all native + LLVM arm32 modes + LP64.

**Follow-up (deferred): SAME-package aggregate-arg func value — the arm32 SHIM's
aggregate re-marshaling.** The by-address fix above handles the CONSUMER + the
cross-pkg (LLVM shim) direction. For a SAME-package aggregate-arg func value, the
arm32 shim must load the by-address pointer and re-expand the aggregate into the
underlying's real ABI (mirror x64/aa64 `emitShimArgMarshal`'s coerced-agg
expansion). Currently `shimUserArgWords` fail-louds aggregate args, so
`matrix/abi/funcval-param/*` (same-pkg) COMPILE_ERROR. Not a hang — a clean
deferred shape; implement alongside the P4-d spill shim or as its own increment.

**P4-a DONE (landed `a888e9cd`):** func-value / indirect-call consumer path
(`arm32_call_indirect.bn`) + the shim's big-aggregate R0-sret return shape + all
six dispatch cases (OP_CALL_INDIRECT/OP_CALL_FUNC_VALUE/OP_CALL_HANDLE/
OP_FUNC_HANDLE/OP_FUNC_VALUE/OP_FUNC_VALUE_DTOR). Conformance 1898/727/32 (+118
pass); adversarial review found 0 defects. (The P4-a land claimed "0 `[10s]`
hangs" — that was WRONG; the hang-detection grep was faulty and missed the
cross-pkg aggregate-arg hang tracked in the MAJOR entry above.) Non-capturing
func-value construct/call/handle-dispatch run end-to-end under QEMU. See
plan-native-arm32.md § P4.

- **small (SizeOf ≤ InternalSretBytes = 4) in-register aggregate return —
  deferred (P4-b).** A struct ≤ 4 bytes (e.g. `struct{x int32}`) is returned BY
  VALUE in R0 on AAPCS32, not via sret (P3.3's single-aggregate-sret covers only
  the > 4-byte case). The in-register pack (callee) + collection (caller) are not
  implemented; the direct-call path AND the P4-a func-value/indirect path both
  fail LOUDLY. The x64 backend packs this size class via `emitAggregateReturnPack`
  / the `!bigRet` RAX(+RDX) store — the arm32 analogue (LDR/STR the ≤ 1-word value
  into/out of R0) is the P4-b port. Covered by `conformance/966_return_small_struct`
  (xfail'd for `builder-comp_native_arm32_baremetal`) and unit tests
  `TestReturnSmallAggregateSetsError` / `TestCallSmallAggregateReturnSetsError`
  (direct) plus `TestFuncValueShimSmallAggregateReturnSetsError` /
  `TestEmitCallFuncValueSmallAggregateReturnSetsError` (func-value). Root cause of
  the fail-loud: the sret predicates use a strict `SizeOf > InternalSretBytes`,
  leaving the `≤ 4` class as a non-sret in-register shape not yet lowered.
- **multi-return (in-register tuple collection AND > register-budget sret) —
  deferred (P4-b).** Fail-loud today (direct, func-value, and iface paths); not
  yet xfail'd per-test (they sit among the native-arm32 conformance failures,
  e.g. `401_return_many_scalars`).
- **int64 / uint64 8-byte scalar in the FIELD / MULTI-RETURN-TUPLE / SRET scalar
  paths — ✅ DONE & LANDED (2026-07-12, `5651fc8b`).** Previously the caller-collect
  (`storeMultiReturnTupleFieldsArm32`), the OP_EXTRACT destructure (`emitExtract`),
  the callee in-register pack (`emitMultiReturnPack`), and the sret write
  (`emitMultiReturnSret`) all failed LOUDLY (`8-byte scalar store/load needs
  register pair (P3+)`) on an int64/uint64 tuple field. Now handled as a
  CONSECUTIVE register pair (NO even-pair bump — AAPCS §6.5 C.3's even rule is
  argument-only; the small-aggregate return coercion packs fields into r0..r3 in
  field order, verified against the LLVM sibling: `{int32,int64}` returns the int64
  in r1:r2, not r2:r3). Helpers `emitExtract64` / `emitPackReturnPair64` (in
  `arm32_int64_mem.bn`) + the pair branches in the collect/pack/sret loops.
  Fixed the 5 int64-blocked conformance tests (`stdlib/strconv/002_parse`,
  `stdlib/time/00{1,2,3}`, `890_chained_method_transitive_struct`) on
  `builder-comp_native_arm32_baremetal`; new regression
  `conformance/regressions/multiret-int64-field` (native arm32 + LP64) + byte-ref
  unit tests (`arm32_int64_multiret_test.bn`, `arm32_int64_mem_test.bn`). NOTE:
  `stdlib/os/010_modtime_chain` was in the same fail-loud set but its remaining
  blocker is the bare-metal no-filesystem limitation (`os.Stat("/tmp")` → errNoFS,
  prints -1 — identical on the LLVM sibling `builder-comp_arm32_baremetal`); now
  xfail'd on that sibling (inherited by native via OVERRIDE_MODE), matching the
  sibling os/008/009 baremetal xfails. **STILL fail-loud: a soft-float FLOAT64
  tuple field** (its FP-in-GP soft-float placement is not yet pinned; P5) — the
  pack / sret / scalar-store paths keep the loud guard for it.
- **soft-float (P5) / VFP hard-float + arm32-linux (P6) / CI wiring (P7)** — see
  the plan doc.

**✅ RESOLVED (`7b4303a6`, 2026-07-12) — superseded by the holistic 0-byte fix (see
done log "0-byte func-value results mishandled across all 3 native backends"): a
0-byte aggregate result is now VOID-LIKE everywhere (routed off the pack path via
`IsAggregateReturn`), so the pack-store guards described below were REMOVED as dead
code. The historical write-up is kept below for context.**

**MINOR / latent (found 2026-07-11, P4-d Phase C.2 follow-up review): a 0-byte
aggregate result (`struct{}` / `[0]T`) routes to the arm32 PACK path and
4-byte-overwrites its 0-byte retbuf.** `shimReturnIsSmallPackAggregateArm32` (and
the non-closure `emitFuncValueShimBody` dispatch, arm32_funcvalue.bn:290-301) gates
the pack path on `SizeOf() <= InternalSretBytes` (4) — a `struct{}` has `SizeOf 0`
and IsAggregateTyp, so 0 ≤ 4 routes it to the pack shim, whose unconditional
`STR R0, [retbuf]` writes a 4-byte garbage word PAST the end of the 0-byte result
buffer (silent memory corruption). It IS reachable: a closure / func value returning
`struct{}` compiles on the LLVM backend (verified) and conformance 1029 has
zero-size struct values. **FIXED in the CLOSURE pack path** (`emitClosureShimPackCoreArm32`,
via `emptyAggregatePackResultArm32` — skips the post-BL store + retbuf reload for a
0-byte single-aggregate result; multi-return is never 0-byte since it has ≥2 fields),
covered by `TestClosureShimPackEmptyStructResultSkipsStore` (mutation-verified: the
test fails if the guard is removed). **The NON-closure pack shim (`emitPackShim`,
arm32_funcvalue.bn:423) has the IDENTICAL unguarded `STR R0, [R4, #0]`** — a plain
`*func() struct{}` (or non-capturing method value returning `struct{}`) hits the same
4-byte-past-end store. Left UNFIXED pending a user decision (the closure fix is the
in-scope P4-d Phase C follow-up; the non-closure shim is the same latent issue in the
sibling P4-b pack path). The same size class should also be audited on x64/aa64's pack
emitters (they pack `≤ InternalSretBytes` too) if a 0-byte result can reach them.

### ARM32 bare-metal target — MAJOR PROJECT
- **Why**: enable Binate as an OS-development language on ARM32
  bare-metal (Cortex-A and possibly Cortex-M). Bare-metal is the
  endgame — we want to write the OS in Binate, not run on top of
  one. **ARM32 Linux via LLVM** has been added to the plan as an
  explicit v0 derisking step (it shares all the prerequisites and
  validates the 32-bit type-system path without committing to
  bare-metal runtime work); see plan doc.
- **Existing substrate that already handles bare-metal cleanly**:
  - `pkg/asm/arm32` encodes ARMv7-A instructions (data-processing,
    load/store, multiply/divide, branches, system); 73 unit tests pin
    bit patterns. Assembler-side is essentially done.
  - `pkg/asm/elf` emits ELF32 with the right ARM32 reloc set
    (R_ARM_JUMP24, R_ARM_ABS32). End-to-end tests in
    `pkg/asm/elf/elf_test.bn` already link with `arm-none-eabi-ld`
    (bare-metal linker) and run under `qemu-system-arm -semihosting`
    on virt machine. Three tests: exit, loop sum, function call.
  - `cmd/bnas` already accepts `.arch arm32` and routes through the
    ARM32 instruction parser.
- **What's missing**: an IR-to-machine-code lowering for ARM32 (a
  `pkg/native/arm32` sibling of `pkg/native/arm64`), and a bare-metal
  runtime port.
- **The interesting bit: bare-metal makes the runtime story
  non-trivial.** Things the language/runtime currently assumes from
  the host that don't exist on bare metal:
  - **Allocator**: `pkg/rt`'s managed-pointer/managed-slice
    allocations go through `bn_rt__c_malloc` / `bn_rt__c_free` /
    `bn_rt__c_calloc` (libc-shaped C stubs). On bare metal we need
    a Binate-implemented allocator — probably a simple bump
    allocator first (no free, suitable for early boot), then a real
    heap (free-list or buddy). Allocator implementation lives in
    pkg/rt (or a peer package) and replaces the `c_*` bridges for
    the bare-metal target. The existing "Un-export `rt.c_*`" TODO
    is a prerequisite — once those are private, we can swap them.
  - **`memset` / `memcpy`**: tiny Binate or asm implementations.
  - **Exit / abort / panic**: semihosting `SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED` for
    QEMU testing; on real hardware, `wfi` loop or reset.
  - **I/O**: no stdout/stderr — need a UART driver or semihosting.
    Two flavors:
    - Semihosting (used by the existing QEMU tests): debug-only,
      requires a debugger / QEMU. Useful for development, not for
      shipping.
    - UART: target-specific MMIO. Need a small driver per board —
      PL011 for ARM virt machine, vendor-specific for real hardware.
      The `bootstrap.Write` extern would dispatch to a board-defined
      `uart_putbyte` instead of `write(2)`.
  - **`bootstrap.*` shape**: today's bootstrap.bni is libc-shaped
    (Open / Read / Write / Stat / Args). Bare metal has no
    filesystem and no argv. We'd want a smaller bare-metal-friendly
    bootstrap interface — probably just an output sink and a panic.
    The `formatInt` / `formatBool` / `formatFloat` helpers stay
    (they're pure Binate); only the I/O surface changes.
- **Boot**: a tiny crt0 in asm (or Binate inline-asm if we ever add
  it) to set up the stack, zero BSS, copy .data from flash to RAM,
  then jump to `bn_main`. Provided as a per-board file alongside the
  linker script.
- **Linker script**: per-board memory map (text/rodata in flash, data
  in RAM, BSS, stack at top of RAM, optional MMU page tables for A-
  class). The QEMU virt machine convention (text at 0x40000000) is a
  good first target.
- **Two paths to actual codegen**, similar to the ARM32-Linux
  consideration but with bare-metal twists:
  - **LLVM-via-clang**: pass `--target=armv7a-none-eabi`,
    `-mfloat-abi=soft` (or `hard` if we want NEON/VFP), no sysroot.
    Fastest to first-light, but the LLVM dependency is heavier on a
    bare-metal toolchain story (we'd need to ship clang + lld or
    require the user to have a cross toolchain installed).
  - **Native pkg/native/arm32**: full sibling of `pkg/native/arm64`.
    AAPCS32 calling convention (NGRN over R0..R3, args 5+ on stack,
    return values in R0..R3, large-aggregate return via the hidden
    pointer in R0). Mach-O isn't relevant here — only ELF32 output.
    No external dependency once written. Larger upfront cost; closer
    to the OS-language goal of "no LLVM at runtime."
- **Testing**: the existing `pkg/asm/elf` semihosting harness scales
  up — write conformance programs that use only the bare-metal
  runtime surface, link with `arm-none-eabi-ld`, run under QEMU
  with `-semihosting`. Once the UART driver lands, switch to
  reading stdout from QEMU's serial0.
- **Adjacent in-flight items that affect this**:
  - "Un-export `rt.c_*`" — direct prerequisite for swapping the
    allocator/memops bridges per-target.
  - "Native AArch64 backend cluster A" — in flight; the
    common AAPCS dispatch helper in `pkg/native/common` is shared
    between ARM64 and a future ARM32, so ARM32 work shouldn't start
    until the ARM64 native backend is stable enough that we know the
    common shape is right.
  - The compiler/interpreter interop work is independent of this —
    interop is mostly a layout/representation question, not a
    target question.
- **Suggested first milestone**: get a meaningful subset of
  conformance running on QEMU via the LLVM backend with semihosting
  I/O. Concretely:
    - Pick the codegen path: LLVM-via-clang first
      (`--target=armv7a-none-eabi -mfloat-abi=soft`). Defer the
      native `pkg/native/arm32` backend until LLVM-via-clang
      validates the runtime/boot/linker story.
    - Implement a bump allocator in `pkg/rt` (no free) — enough for
      every conformance test that doesn't actually run out of memory.
      Allocations touch managed-pointer / managed-slice paths only,
      so this is the same surface the existing `c_malloc`/`c_calloc`
      bridges expose. Wire it behind a build-mode switch alongside
      the existing libc-bridges path.
    - Implement semihosting `SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED` (already used by the
      pkg/asm/elf QEMU tests) and `SYS_WRITE0` for putchar/print.
      Replace `bootstrap.Write` (the I/O primitive everything
      eventually funnels into after the print rewire) with the
      semihosting variant for this target.
    - Add `memset` / `memcpy` in pure Binate (or a tiny inline-asm
      wrapper if one is later added).
    - Conformance tests that DON'T touch file I/O / argv / dirs
      should pass: arithmetic, control flow, structs, slices,
      managed pointers, methods, etc. Probably 200+ of the existing
      278. Tests that rely on `bootstrap.Open` / `Read` / `Args` /
      `Stat` / `ReadDir` / `Exec` would be excluded for v1.
- **Plan doc**: `explorations/plan-arm32-bare-metal.md` exists as a
  **DRAFT** (initial sketch — not yet ratified). Covers the items
  above plus: target board choice (QEMU virt + one real Cortex-A
  board TBD), allocator design (bump first, heap second), bare-
  metal `bootstrap.bni` shape, boot/linker-script convention, and a
  placeholder for the per-package inventory of `bootstrap.*` calls
  (the inventory itself is deferred to a follow-up). Needs review
  pass before any implementation begins.

## stdx containers: Map/Set key-type ergonomics

Motivation for both entries below: the container-adoption audit (2026-07-09,
see the `Adopt stdx/containers Vec …` opportunistic entry) found that `Vec[T]`
is usable across the non-BUILDER tools *now*, but `hashmap.Map[K lang.Hashable,
V]` and `set.Set[T lang.Hashable]` are blocked at nearly every real site —
because those all key on an *identifier or path name* spelled `@[]char`, and
only scalar primitives implement `lang.Hashable`
(`impls/core/common/pkg/builtins/lang/order.bn`; no impl for `@[]char`/`[]char`,
any slice/pointer, or any struct). Blocked sites include vm's `func_index.bn`
(an ENTIRE hand-rolled djb2 open-addressing hashmap on the hot func-resolution
path — the smoking gun), vm `LookupExtern`/`lookupGlobalAddr`/`findIfaceVtable`,
lint `unused_func` reachability + `refs`/`unused_local` membership, interp/repl
path-dedup sets, and asm/parse's const symbol table. Two complementary ways to
unblock them:

### Derived/structural Hashable for aggregates (slices, arrays, structs of Hashables) — 🟡 DESIGN OPEN (2026-07-09)
- **Idea**: make an aggregate whose components are all `lang.Hashable` itself
  `lang.Hashable`, derived structurally: a slice `@[]T`/`[]T` and array `[N]T`
  with `T: Hashable` (Hash = fold over element hashes; Compare = element-wise /
  lexicographic), and a struct whose fields are all Hashable (Hash = combine
  field hashes; Compare = field-by-field). Since `char` is Hashable (via its
  `uint8` alias), this makes `@[]char` — *the* Binate string — Hashable, so
  identifier/path-name keys "just work" with no new type.
- **Why this over a dedicated string type** (the user's steer, 2026-07-09):
  adding a distinct `String` type to be the Hashable key conflicts with the
  widespread `@[]char`-as-string convention, including `std/strings` (which
  operates on `@[]char`/`*Builder`, not a string type). We'd end up with two
  string representations and conversion friction. Structural Hashable keeps
  `@[]char` as the string and just makes aggregates-of-Hashables usable as keys.
- **Open design questions**:
  - Automatic/blanket vs. opt-in: is this a built-in structural rule in the type
    system, or a conditional generic impl (`impl []T : Hashable where
    T:Hashable`)? Binate today has NO derived/blanket impls, and the
    `AllowUniverseRecv` gate restricts who may `impl` on universe
    primitives/slices — where would these impls live, and can the constraint
    system express the conditional form?
  - Hash fold + Compare semantics (which mixing function; is lexicographic the
    intended slice `Compare`?).
  - Scope: `@[]T` and `[]T`; arrays `[N]T`; structs. Pointers (`@T`/`*T`) should
    almost certainly NOT auto-derive (identity-vs-pointee hashing is a footgun) —
    leave them out.
  - Cost: `Hash`/`Compare` on `@[]char` is O(len) — fine for map keys.
- **Relatedly — should the comparison OPERATORS drive `.Compare`? (folded in 2026-07-11)** The
  question "should any `==`-capable type automatically have a `.Compare` (with `== iff Compare==0`),
  and any `<`-capable type a `.Compare` (with `< iff Compare<0`)?" is **the same call as this entry**,
  one layer down (`Compare`, not `Hash`). The **`<`-side is moot**: the only `<`-capable types are
  the numeric scalars, which `lang` already ships as `Orderable` with a `<`-consistent `Compare` — no
  non-scalar type has `<` (operator overloading is off the table). The **`==`-side is the live one**:
  `==`-capable *aggregates* (structs/arrays, §13.6 `expr.compare.aggregate`) have `==` but **no**
  `.Compare` today; making them auto-`Comparable` with `== iff Compare==0` **is exactly this
  structural derivation** (its derived-`Comparable`/`Compare` half). Key: the **consistency guarantee**
  (`== iff Compare==0`) is only achievable by the compiler *deriving* `Compare` from `==` — a
  hand-written `Comparable` impl on an `==`-capable struct can silently disagree with `==` (like
  `Orderable`'s unenforced total-order promise). **So decide `==`→auto-`Compare` HERE:** adopt
  structural derivation → `==`-capable aggregates are auto-`Comparable` (consistent by construction),
  `Hashable` following with a component-`Hashable` constraint; keep no-derived-impls → aggregates need
  explicit impls and operator↔`Compare` consistency is at most a documented, unenforced obligation.
  (`Equatable`/`Equals` was considered and **rejected** 2026-07-11 — keep just `Comparable`+`Orderable`;
  equality stays `Compare==0`. And operators are never available on generic type params — spec
  `expr.compare.typeparam`, §13.6.)
- **Payoff**: unblocks the entire compiler-domain Map/Set class in one move,
  including deleting vm's hand-rolled `func_index.bn` hashmap in favour of
  `hashmap.Map`. Supersedes the key half of the "168 `slices.Append` in loops"
  note elsewhere in this file — the same key-ergonomics gap.

### Container variants taking an explicit hash/eq function (not requiring Hashable) — 🟡 DESIGN OPEN (2026-07-09)
- **Idea**: offer container variants (or constructors) that accept an explicit
  `hash: *func(T) uint` + `eq`/`compare` function instead of constraining the key
  to `lang.Hashable`. E.g. a `hashmap.NewWith(hashFn, eqFn)` / a parallel
  `HashMapFn[K any, V]` type whose K is unconstrained.
- **Why**: the escape hatch for (a) keys that shouldn't or can't be Hashable,
  (b) custom hashing/equality (case-insensitive names, hash-by-one-field,
  pointer-by-identity), and (c) perf-tuned hashers — without forcing a wrapper
  struct + hand-written `impl : lang.Hashable` at every such site. Complementary
  to structural Hashable: structural handles the common ergonomic case (name
  keys); explicit-fn handles the custom/opt-out case.
- **Open design questions**:
  - Variant type vs. optional-fn-in-the-existing-Map (the latter mixes
    constraint-dispatch and fn-dispatch awkwardly; a separate variant is likely
    cleaner).
  - Whether the fns are stored as `*func`/`@func` in the container struct —
    function values exist (non-capturing at BUILDER, capturing in the full
    language; containers are non-BUILDER, so capturing is available). A
    function-value type mentioning the container's type param (`*func(K)` / `@func(K)`)
    now substitutes `K` at instantiation (**RESOLVED** — the func-value type-traversal
    fixes plus the generic-instantiation-as-constraint-arg work landed `2f8969e8`;
    conformance `1035_policy_core_dispatch` exercises `FnPolicy[K] struct { hash
    *func(K) uint }` passed as a constraint-satisfying type arg, and `1034` the plain
    generic-policy case). So storage-as-field and fn-parameter forms compile now; each
    instantiation still monomorphizes; the hash/eq become indirect calls per probe (no
    interface dispatch).
  - **Variant vs base, and the perf tradeoff.** The current `Map`/`Set` deliberately use
    DIRECT monomorphized `key.Hash()` / `key.Compare()` calls (no indirection). An
    injected-fn form pays an indirect call per probe + carries fn-value fields. So a
    separate variant (`HashMapFn[K any, V]`) that leaves the fast `Hashable` `Map`
    untouched is likely cleaner than making the injected form the base (which would slow
    the common case) — unless the shared-open-addressing-core refactor (§7 of
    plan-stdx-containers.md) is done so both share one impl parameterized by the fns.
    Alternatively, inject an interface (`@Hasher[K]`) instead of raw fns — buildable
    today (generic interfaces work) but clunkier (a named type + impl per strategy vs a
    lambda) and adds vtable dispatch.

## Opportunistic code cleanups

### Adopt `stdx/containers` Vec for hand-rolled growable arrays — 🟡 UNBLOCKED, IN PROGRESS (audit 2026-07-09)
- **UNBLOCKED 2026-07-10** — the MAJOR cross-package generic-container mangler bug
  that blocked this (cross-package managed-element container dtor/copy mangling) is
  FIXED & LANDED (`8d9e7577`; entry in claude-todo-done.md).  `Vec[T]` (and Map/Set)
  now link/run cross-package on managed element types.  The formatter conversion
  (`Vec[@[]readonly char]`, the site that first surfaced the bug) was reverted at the
  time and can now be redone; that is the natural first adoption to resume.  The two
  follow-on named-distinct *wrapper* element bugs (`type Buf @[]@X` as the Vec
  element — the `ensureMsDtor`/`ensureArrayDtor` dtor recursion `c14dd95e` and its
  `genArrayCopy`/`ensureArrayCopy` copy twin `aba92526`) are ALSO FIXED & LANDED (both
  in claude-todo-done.md), so wrapper elements work too.
- **What**: the container-adoption audit swept the non-BUILDER tree (vm, interp,
  lint, format, repl, and the cmd/{bni,bnfmt,bnlint} glue — the stdlib itself is
  largely BUILDER-constrained, since cmd/bnc imports std/{os,strings,strconv} and
  stdx/slices) and found ~30 verified `vec.Vec[T]` adoption sites, all one
  anti-pattern: building a slice by repeated single-element append (O(n²)). Three
  spellings, all fixed by `Vec.Push` (amortized O(1)):
  - Bespoke `appendXxx` recopy helpers (`make_slice(n+1)`+copy): `interp/util.bn`
    (`appendCharSlice`/`appendFilePtr`/`appendImportSpec`, used across imports/
    check/externs/interp), `cmd/bni/util.bn` (same trio), `cmd/bnlint/main.bn`
    (`appendStr`/`appendImport`), repl (`appendByteRepl` O(n²)-per-line
    accumulator, `appendReplError`). Vec deletes these helpers outright.
  - `slices.Append` in a loop: the formatter wrap engine (8 near-identical
    `strs`/`lines` sites: `print_wrap.bn:124/146/169`, `print_builtin.bn:62`,
    `print_switch.bn:79`, `print_decl.bn:179`, `print_chain.bn:34`,
    `print_file.bn:113`); vm `lower.bn:263` / `satentry_inject.bn` /
    `lower_pkg_descriptor.bn` (×5) / `lower_data.bn`.
  - Manual capacity/length growers (a `@[]T` field + external `N…` counter):
    `cmd/bnlint/suppress.bn` (`Sups`/`Bad`) + `main.bn:472` (`appendMsg`
    +`NumDiags`), `cmd/bnfmt/main.bn:174` (`readFile` byte buffer), lint
    `refs.bn` (`growNames`), `unused_func.bn`, `unused_local.bn`.
- **Ownership caveat**: `Vec.Items()` is a *view* into the backing, not an owned
  slice. Vec fits persistent accumulator fields and build-then-hand-to-a-
  synchronous-consumer; it's a poor fit for build-and-return-an-owned-slice (you'd
  return the Vec or copy out). This is why the `cmd/bni` `readReplLine`/
  `appendByteRepl` twin was verified OUT (returns an owned right-sized slice).
- **Not opportunities** (verified out): `vm.Funcs` (already `slices.Append`; a
  bare indexed dispatch field — converting ripples through dozens of index sites
  for zero growth code), vm `vtable_inject` parallel arrays (deliberate
  struct-of-arrays), `strconv.Append*` (pos-based fixed-dst writers, not
  containers).
- **Map/Set half is BLOCKED** on the missing Hashable name key — see the two
  "stdx containers: Map/Set key-type ergonomics" entries above. Until one of
  those lands, the symbol-table/dedup-set sites stay linear scans.
- **How to land**: one site (or one helper-family) per commit, keeping tests +
  the `bnfmt-format`/unit suites green; start with the formatter wrap engine
  (uniform, well-tested, synchronous consumer — no ownership wrinkle) or the
  `interp`/`cmd-bni` append-helper family (deletes the most code). `vec.Vec` IS
  the "growable container with amortised O(1) append" the earlier "168
  `slices.Append` in loops" note asked to file for later.

### Use interfaces more (opportunistic)
- **Constraint**: now bounded by `BUILDER_VERSION`-pinned bnc
  rather than the historical bootstrap subset — cmd/bnc no longer
  has to be bootstrap-runnable now that boot mode is gone (binate
  `c1be3cc`, 2026-05-21).  bnc-0.0.1 (the current BUILDER) supports
  interfaces, so anything in cmd/bnc's dep tree is fair game too.
  Generics are NOT in bnc-0.0.1, but interfaces are.
- **Candidates that look natural**: anywhere we currently
  switch on a kind tag with a dispatch table (e.g. opcode
  handlers, AST visitors, asm encoders) is the textbook shape
  where an interface compresses the dispatch.  Print/format
  helpers that take a kind + value pair are another easy lift.
  pkg/ast's tagged-union nodes (DECL_*, EXPR_*, STMT_*, TEXPR_*
  Kind enums + switch-on-Kind in pkg/{parser,types,ir,codegen,
  loader}) is the biggest single target but also the longest
  refactor — touches every layer.
- **How to land**: pick one site per PR, define the interface
  alongside, methodify the concrete types, drop the dispatch
  switch.  Keeps each step small enough that conformance +
  unit-tests stay green.  Mirrors the
  `migrate-to-method-form-opportunistic` pattern from
  `claude-todo-done.md` (DONE 2026-05-13).
- **Recon finding (2026-05-26)**: there is NO clean *small*
  retrofit target.  The candidates above split into two
  unappealing buckets: (a) enum→value lookups (reloc maps,
  opName, the emitInstr op dispatch) where `switch` is genuinely
  the right tool and an interface would mean manufacturing one
  empty marker type per enum value — pure ceremony; and (b)
  monolithic tagged unions (`ast.Stmt`/`Decl`, `ir.Instr`) where
  a real interface means splitting a struct that touches every
  layer.  So "use interfaces more" here is a deliberate design
  choice, not opportunistic cleanup.
- **Landed (2026-05-26): driver `Backend` interface** (binate
  `0ee0faa`, `bda81ca`, `6dacb23`).  The genuinely-valuable use
  found: `cmd/bnc/compile.bn`'s `Backend` interface
  (`compileModule`) with `llvmBackend` / `nativeBackend` impls,
  dispatched via `compileModuleVia`.  This collapsed the
  duplicated driver flow — `compileMainNative` is gone, `main()`
  picks the backend and the LLVM/native paths are unified.
  pkg/native also got an internal arch `Backend`
  (arm64/amd64).  These are the first non-synthetic interface
  users beyond pkg/std's `Stringer`.  NOTE: interface values
  must be constructed from locals, not package globals — `&global`
  iface construction was a codegen bug (now fixed, see
  conformance/495).

### Use `@[]@[]char{...}` composite literals (opportunistic)
- **Constraint**: previously forbidden because bootstrap didn't
  support managed-slice-of-managed-slice composite literals; now
  unlocked everywhere (bnc-0.0.1 supports them).  Mirrors the
  unconstraint situation for `cmd/bnlint`'s tests, which already
  use this shape.
- **Pattern to replace**: a known-fixed-length run of
  `args = appendCharSlice(args, "foo"); args = appendCharSlice(args, "bar"); ...`
  → `var args @[]@[]char = @[]@[]char{"foo", "bar", ...}`.  Same
  shape for `appendRawCharSlice` (since string literals are
  already `*[]const char`).  When the run mixes constants with
  computed values, leave it alone — the literal form only helps
  for known-static sets.
- **Candidates**: argv construction in build scripts (e.g.
  `cmd/bnc/{main,test,compile}.bn` clang-args setup), test
  scaffolding (anywhere a test builds a known `@[]@[]char`
  fixture), and short fixed sets of import paths.
- **Why bother**: cuts line count, removes a runtime O(n²)
  rebuild pattern (each `appendCharSlice` allocates a new
  slice + copies), and matches the language's expressive
  default instead of the bootstrap workaround.

### Use function values to collapse explicit dispatch shims (opportunistic)
- **Constraint**: function values are unlocked now that
  cmd/bnc is no longer bootstrap-bound; bnc-0.0.1 has the
  function-value machinery (see plan-function-values-phase-3
  in `claude-todo-done.md`).
- **Pattern to look for**: places where we route through a
  `kind` int + a per-kind dispatch table, when the data flow
  would be clearer as "the caller hands us the function it
  wants invoked".  Candidates need a closer look before they're
  fully scoped — function-value adoption isn't always a win
  (each call adds an indirect-call overhead), so this is
  selectively-opportunistic, not blanket.
- **How to land**: TBD; needs concrete site survey.

### Replace if-return chains with `switch` where applicable (opportunistic)
- **Pattern**: code that does
  `if x == A { ... return ... }; if x == B { ... return ... }; ...`
  over many cases.  Common in op-dispatchers, kind-handlers, and
  predicates.
- **Why it matters**: a `switch` makes the structure obvious (all
  cases over the same scrutinee, mutually exclusive), gives the
  type-checker a hook for exhaustiveness checking if/when it
  lands, and reads more naturally.
- **Watch out for**: chains where the conditions aren't really
  equality on a single scrutinee — those genuinely are
  if/else-if and should stay.  Also: the bootstrap subset
  supports `switch`, so this isn't restricted to non-bootstrap
  code (unlike the interface TODO above).
- **How to land**: opportunistic.  Top candidates: the per-op
  dispatchers in `pkg/native/arm64/arm64_dispatch.bn`,
  `pkg/codegen/emit_instr.bn`, `pkg/vm/vm_exec*.bn`, and
  `pkg/ir/ir_ops.bn`'s opName / similar string-form helpers.
- **Landed (2026-05-25/26)**: the big per-op dispatchers are
  converted — `pkg/vm/vm_exec_pure.bn` + `vm_exec_helpers.bn`
  (binate `b4456ab`, `e4e7d29`), `pkg/codegen/emit_instr.bn`
  (`2d6d0f7`), `pkg/native/arm64/arm64_dispatch.bn` (`3756acc`).
  Where a chain mixes equality cases with op-RANGE checks
  (emit_instr's OP_ADD..OP_SHR / OP_EQ..OP_GE; arm64_dispatch's
  emitCompare/emitBinop/emitUnop delegates), the range arms stay
  as guards alongside the switch.  `ir_ops.bn`'s opName was
  already a switch — nothing to do there.  This work flushed out
  a CRITICAL case-scope miscompile (managed local in a `case`
  body), since fixed (`4306197`; archived in claude-todo-done.md).
  Remaining candidates are smaller / lower-value (assorted
  if-chains in cmd/* and pkg/* tools).

### Clean up conformance tests to use array literal + `arr[:]` pattern
- `arr[:]` works in compiled mode; conformance tests using `make_slice` + indexed assignment for static data could use `[N]T{...}` + `arr[:]` instead
- Consider adding slice literal syntax (`*[]T{...}`) as sugar
